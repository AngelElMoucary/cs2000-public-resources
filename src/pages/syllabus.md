### Course Description

Introduces computer science and data science to students with no prior programming experience. Starts by building programs with numbers, text, and images. Explores real, complex datasets both interactively and through coding by doing data analysis, constructing graphs, and computing interesting results. Offers students an opportunity to build a solid foundation and practice coding with a popular industrial coding language with a professional programmerâ€™s interface to the code. Covers skills needed to identify and respond to ethical challenges that arise in the program design process.

### Course Structure

There will be three in-person **classes** (in Boston & Oakland) or two in-person **classes** (in NYC), one **lab**, and one _optional_ **recitation** per week. All content is directed around teaching a set of 12 **skills**, assessment of which will form the primary assessment of the class, and which are described in detail at [Skills](/skills). 

Each class period (of CS2000) has reading you are expected to do _before_ class. During the class we will briefly review the new material that was covered in the reading (but, in much less depth -- it is not a substitute for doing the reading), and then the majority of class will be dedicated to working with classmates, assisted by your instructor, on exercises related to the new material. 

The lab period (CS2001) will include a set of exercises to be done with a partner in your lab section, guided by those running the lab (TAs or instructors). Labs will be graded primarily by effort & attendance. The recitation is an _optional_ additional practice session with TAs, to allow students who want more practice on the topic of the week to work through exercises with guidance.

Students can register for any CS 2001 lab section on their campus.

There will also be **weekly homework** assignments. The purpose of homework is to give you hands-on experience with the course material you learned in lecture, and to teach you the skills used for the **skill assessments**.

There are also 12 **skills**, repeatable, on paper, no-note, assessment of which forms the primary grading for the class. 

There are no quizzes or exams in this class.

### Skills

The course will teach the following skills, grading of which will be performed by repeatable (with highest grade taken), on-paper, no-note, assessment that can be scored as "Doesn't meet expectations", "Approaching expectations", or "Meets expectations". See the [Skills](/skills) page for much more detail.

1. Design basic functions (Pyret)
2. Construct / Transform Tables (Pyret)
3. Iteration: Lists (Pyret)
4. Structured & Conditional Data (Pyret)
5. Recursion: Lists (Pyret)
6. Recursion: Trees (Pyret)
7. Variable Scope (Python)
8. Design basic functions (Python)
9. Iteration: Lists (Python)
10. Aliasing & Mutation (Python)
11. Identifying Privacy Issues in Problem Formulation
12. Identifying Stakeholders in Problem Formulation

### Grading

Grades will be primarily assigned by achievement levels of the course
[Skills](/skills/), along with required grade thresholds on HW for each letter grade,
and + (other than A) given for participation in 8 or more out of 10 labs, - given for participating in fewer than 6 out of ten labs.

This is captured by the following table -- the highest row that a student satisfies all columns of will be their grade, and if no rows are completely satisfied, the student will not pass the course.

Grade | Skills Needed | HW Needed 
-- | -- | --
A | Meets expectations on 10+/12, Approaching expectations on remainder | 85% or better
B | Meets expectations on 8+/12, Approaching expectations on remainder | 75% or better
C | Meets expectations on 5+/12, Approaching expectations on remainder | 65% or better
D | Approaching expectations or better on 9+/12 | 55% or better


### Textbook

We will follow the textbook "A Data-Centric Introduction to Computing", 
by Fisler, Krishnamurthi, Lerner, and Politz. It is freely available online at 
https://dcic.pdi.run, and all readings will be linked to from appropriate parts of 
this site.


### Recitation Times

In addition to general purpose Office Hours held by TAs, there will be dedicated Recitation Hours held by TAs. These optional sessions, scheduled throughout the day, will have particular exercises and material that they go over, and will not assist with homework problems. Attendance will be limited based on room size, but enough should be scheduled to allow students to attend if they want.

## Collaboration and Academic Honesty

Computer science, both academically and professionally, is a collaborative discipline. In any collaboration, however, all parties are expected to make their own contributions and to generously credit the contributions of others. In our class, therefore, collaboration on assignments is encouraged, but you as an individual are responsible for understanding all the material in the assignment and doing your own work. Always strive to do your best, give generous credit to others, start early, and seek help early from both your professors and classmates.

The following rules are intended to help you get the most out of your education and to clarify the line between honest and dishonest work. The professor reserves the right to ask you to verbally explain the reasoning behind any answer or code that you turn in and to modify your grade based on your answers. It is vitally important that you turn in work that is your own and follow the guidelines for academic honesty. The minimum penalty for an academic integrity violation is a zero on the assignment and a report to the [Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSCCR)](https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/). Penalties are increased if there are aggravating factors, such as stealing another student's work or lying about cheating.

In detail:
- You must understand the material you turn in.
- Copying material from another person without their knowledge is not allowed.
- Additionally, sharing solutions in public forums (e.g., posting to public questions, posting code online, etc) constitutes an academic integrity violation, as it may make it harder for other students to do work on their own, harming their own learning.

However, there are other cases that do not violate policies, but where we still offer strong _guidelines_: 

> **Collaboration Guidelines**
> We _recommend_ that you _write_ all code yourself. Even if you discuss solutions, or approaches, with others, 
> have all the actual typing be your own (and should not be merely typing what someone says, or typing 
> what you see on anothers screen). Because there is lots of gray area in this, we do not consider violations of this to be academic 
> integrity violations, but there are many versions that are a good way to not learn the material, and in this class, not learning the 
> material will result in not being able to pass the skill assessments. Even with perfect homework scores, failing to 
> pass sufficient skill assessments may result in a failing grade in the course, so take homework for what it is 
> intended: extensive opportunity to practice the skills we are teaching, paired with high quality feedback 
> about the solution you came up with.

If you have a question about the difference between our policies and guidelines, please ask an instructor.

If you feel that cheating is your only option, please ask for help.

### The AI Policy

As with our **Collaboration Guidelines**, we offer guidelines around use. While violations of this are not considered 
academic integrity violations, they will result in you learning less from the course, which with both directly hurt you,
as you may end up failing sufficient skill assessments to either fail the course or do much more poorly than you had hoped,
but also indirectly hurt you, as you will not have built the foundation for future courses that this course intends. 

As a result, we offer similar **AI Guidelines** -- these are strong recommendations, as we believe that deviations from 
this will result in direct harm to your education.

> **AI Guidelines**
> AI coding assistants like Cursor, Windsurf, and Copilot should not be used in this course. We believe that using an AI assistant is an important skill that should be covered _after_ the basics (which is why there is a different policy in CS 3100). Until you have the ability to design, understand, and review code, using an AI assistant amounts to wandering around in the dark, with no ability to determine if you are getting closer to what you want. 
>
> The same is true of asking questions of chat models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Putting in assignment instructions into such a model and getting out code or test cases, amounts to getting the model to do the thinking for you -- and as a result, you will not learn. "Only look"ing at AI-generated solutions "before writing your own" undermines the learning just the same, as you will not be learning to actually solve problems, you will just be copying (and, importantly, never developing the ability to recognize when the AI generated solution isn't what you want).
> 
> Part of the reason for these being guidelines, rather than academic integrity policies, is that some interaction with LLMs is now unavoidable -- using a search engine now will give you an AI generated overview, and similar interactions with models (trying to understand concepts) is not necessarily discouraged, though we would always encourage you to bring larger questions to our course staff, who will likely be able to give you better answers, more suited to your background, to our curriculum, etc.
>
> Finally, if you do use LLMs for search, you are responsible for validating any information you find. Sources of ground truth are official language documentation, our course textbook, course staff, and the course website.
