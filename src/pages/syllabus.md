### Weekly Labs
Each week will have a lab section, staffed by TAs and serving to reinforce the topics covered in the given week in a setting with significant assistance. Students will work in pairs, supervised by the TAs, to accomplish specific programming tasks that should be completed by the end of the lab period. The labs will be graded by participation.


### Recitation Times

In addition to general purpose Office Hours held by TAs, there will be dedicated Recitation Hours held by TAs. These optional sessions, scheduled throughout the day, will have particular exercises and material that they go over, and will not assist with homework problems. Attendance will be limited based on room size, but enough should be scheduled to allow students to attend if they want.


### Grading

Grades will be primarily assigned by achievement levels of the course
