# Skills

This course will teach the following skills, repeated assessment of which will
form the primary source of final grades. 

Each skill will be marked as "Doesn't meet expectations", "Approaching
expectations", and "Meets expectations", and students may attempt any skill
assessment up to four times, with the best result being used for their grade.

## Skill Introduction

Skills will be introduced in certain weeks (and may be re-inforced in later
weeks), via class, recitation, labs, and HW. Each of these will be marked with what skill is being introduced or reinforced by the material.

## Skill Assessment

Assessment of skills can be done at many different opportunities.

### Assessable@Hours

Every week, there will be several special hours held by instructors, course
coordinators, or graduate TAs, that exist solely for the purpose of taking
assessments. The skills assessable at these hours are those that were introduced
the previous several weeks -- see the table below to see what skill is
assessable in any given week via this mechanism.

This is intended to allow you several attempts at the skill after the content is
introduced, but require you to keep up with the material -- all assessments
cannot be deferred to the end of the semester, since only the last few skills
can be attempted at the end of the semester.

### Skill Days

Several class days exist as gaps in our schedule, and some of the class may be
used to catch up on material, but 30+ mins of class will be used for skill
assessments. Instructors will bring a set of assessments -- students are able to
attempt any of those available (likely, due to time, 1-2 of them). See the
schedule below to see what weeks these occur in, and what skills are assessable
during each one.

- <a id="(day1)" href="#(day1)">Skill Day 1</a>:  [1](/skills/#(1)), [2](/skills/#(2)), [11](/skills/#(11)), [12](/skills/#(12))
- <a id="(day2)" href="#(day2)">Skill Day 2</a>: [3](/skills/#(3)), [4](/skills/#(4)), [5](/skills/#(5)), [11](/skills/#(11)), [12](/skills/#(12))
- <a id="(day3)" href="#(day3)">Skill Day 3</a>: [6](/skills/#(6)), [7](/skills/#(7)), [8](/skills/#(8)), [9](/skills/#(9)), [10](/skills/#(10))

### Skill Bundles

Finally, there are two bulk assessment slots, which take place during normal lab
time, during the semester. These collectively cover all of the skills for the
semester, and students are welcome to attempt all of the assessments available
-- every student will be given a packet with a set of assessments when they come
to the lab session. If they have already completed a given skill, they can skip
that one, and if they have already completed all the skills, they are welcome to
skip the bulk assessment entirely. The two bundles are:

- <a id="(bundle1)" href="#(bundle1)">Skill Bundle 1</a>: [1](#(1)), [2](#(2)), [3](#(3)), [4](#(4)), [5](#(5)), [11](#(11)), [12](#(12))
- <a id="(bundle2)" href="#(bundle2)">Skill Bundle 2</a>:  [6](#(6)), [7](#(7)), [8](#(8)), [9](#(9)), [10](#(10)), [11](#(11)), [12](#(12))
