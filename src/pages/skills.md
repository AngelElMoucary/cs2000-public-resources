This course will teach the following skills, repeated assessment of which will
form the primary source of final grades.

1. <a id="(1)" href="#(1)">Design basic functions (Pyret)</a>
2. <a id="(2)" href="#(2)">Construct / Transform Tables (Pyret)</a>
3. <a id="(3)" href="#(3)">Iteration: Lists (Pyret)</a>
4. <a id="(4)" href="#(4)">Structured & Conditional Data (Pyret)</a>
5. <a id="(5)" href="#(5)">Recursion: Lists (Pyret)</a>
6. <a id="(6)" href="#(6)">Recursion: Trees (Pyret)</a>
7. <a id="(7)" href="#(7)">Variable Scope (Pyret)</a>
8. <a id="(8)" href="#(8)">Design basic functions (Python)</a>
9. <a id="(9)" href="#(9)">Iteration: Lists (Python)</a>
10. <a id="(10)" href="#(10)">Aliasing & Mutation (Python)</a>
11. <a id="(11)" href="#(11)">Identifying Privacy Issues in Problem Formulation</a>
12. <a id="(12)" href="#(12)">Identifying Stakeholders in Problem Formulation</a> 

Skills will be introduced in certain weeks (and may be re-inforced in later
weeks), and then can assessments on them can be done in the following several
weeks via any of the assessment opportunities. Also, there are two bulk
assessment slots ("Skill Bundles") during the semester: 

- <a href="(bundle1)" href="#(bundle1)">Skill Bundle 1</a>: [1](#(1)), [2](#(2)), [3](#(3)), [4](#(4)), [7](#(7)), [11](#(11)), [12](#(12))
- <a href="(bundle1)" href="#(bundle1)">Skill Bundle 1</a>: [5](#(5)), [6](#(6)), [8](#(8)), [9](#(9)), [10](#(10)), [11](#(11)), [12](#(12))

During those slots, you will be given assessments for all the skills in the
bundle; you can do as many or as few as you want (and for any skills you have
already demonstrated proficiency for, you do not need to do anything).
