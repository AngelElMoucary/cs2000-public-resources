## Introduction
Building on your work with housing data from Homework 4, you'll now analyze the relationship between NYC housing patterns and school demographics by working with 2 datasets.
You'll be working with two CSV files:
1. housing.csv, which you worked with in Homework 4 and has the following columns:
   - borough: The NYC borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island)
   - zipcode: ZIP code of the property
   - address: Street address of the property
   - landuse: Type of land use (residential, commercial, etc.)
   - ownertype: Category of property ownership
   - lotarea: Total lot area in square feet
   - bldgarea: Total building area in square feet
   - latitude: Latitude coordinate of the property
   - longitude: Longitude coordinate of the property
2. schools.csv, which represents NYC's public schools and has the following columns:
    - schoolname: Name of the school
    - latitude: Latitude coordinate of the school
    - longitude: Longitude coordinate of the school
    - address: Street address of the school
    - city: City in which the school is located
    - zip: ZIP code of the school
    - percentasian, percentblack, percenthispanic, percentblackhispanic, percentwhite: Demographics (as percentage strings like "16%")

## Problem 1
Load the NYC schools data from the CSV file into a table. Define a table called `schools-table` with the appropriate column names and types.

## Problem 2
### Part A
Find which ZIP codes have both housing and schools to identify complete neighborhoods. Extract the "zipcode" column from `housing-table` into a list called `housing-zips` and the "zip" column from `schools-table` into a list called `school-zips`. Create `unique-housing-zips` and `unique-school-zips` containing only distinct ZIP codes from each dataset.
### Part B
Design a function `has-both-housing-and-schools` that takes a ZIP code and returns true if it appears in both ZIP code lists. Use this function with the appropriate list operation to create `complete-neighborhoods` containing ZIP codes that have both housing and schools.

## Problem 3
Analyze residential building sizes in areas with schools by filtering `housing-table` to create `residential-properties` containing only properties with landuse codes "1", "2", or "3" (residential buildings). Extract the ZIP codes from these residential properties into `residential-zips`. Use the appropriate list operation to create `residential-zips-with-schools` containing only residential ZIP codes that also appear in your school ZIP codes list (`unique-school-zips`) from Problem 2.

## Problem 4
### Part A
Calculate simple distances between housing and schools using coordinates by extracting the `latitude` and `longitude` coordinates from both datasets. Then, calculate the geographic centers:
- `center-housing-lat`: Average latitude of all housing
- `center-school-lat`: Average latitude of all schools

### Part B
Design a function `simple-distance` that takes two latitudes and returns their absolute difference. Use the appropriate list operation to create `distances-from-housing-center` showing how far each individual school is from the average housing location.
