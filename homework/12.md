## Introduction
You're working as a data analyst for "StreamingStats", a movie and TV streaming platform. The company has provided you with datasets containing user viewing habits, content ratings, and subscription information. Your job is to clean, analyze, and visualize this data to help the business understand viewer preferences and platform performance.

## Setup
Make sure to include these imports at the top of your file:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
You have been provided with a CSV file containing streaming platform viewing data with the following columns: user_id, content_title, genre, watch_time_minutes, rating, subscription_type. Load the CSV file into a DataFrame and complete the following problems.

## Problem 1
### Part A
- Use `.loc` to get the watch time for the row with index 2
- Use `.iloc` to get the same watch time value using position-based indexing 
Verify that both methods return the same value

### Part B 
Filter and access data based on these conditions:
- Find all data for user_id 105 using boolean indexing with `.loc`
- Extract the genre column as a Series

## Problem 2
### Part A
Create boolean masks to filter the data to:
- Find all Sci-Fi content
- Find all viewing sessions longer than 40 minutes
- Find all content rated above 4.0

### Part B
Design a function `filter_by_rating` that takes a DataFrame and a minimum rating, and returns only the rows with ratings at or above that threshold.

## Problem 3
You've received a messy dataset with the following issues:
```python
messy_data = {
    'show_name': ['breaking bad', 'FRIENDS', 'The Office', 'stranger things', 'Breaking Bad'],
    'subscription_type': ['Premium', 'basic', 'PREMIUM', 'Basic', 'premium'],
    'monthly_cost': ['12.99', '8.99', 'twelve', '8.99', '12.99'],
    'user_age': [25, 'thirty-five', 28, 32, 29]
}
```
Clean the data by:
1. Converting all show names to title case
2. Standardizing subscription types to lowercase
3. Fixing the "twelve" entry in monthly_cost and converting the column to numeric
4. Replacing "thirty-five" with 35 and converting user_age to numeric

## Problem 4
### Part A
Using your cleaned viewing data, create new columns:
- `watch_hours`: Convert watch_time_minutes to hours
- `binge_session`: Boolean indicating if watch_time > 120 minutes

### Part B
Then, create conditional columns:
- `price_tier`: "Budget" for monthly_cost < 10, "Standard" for 10-15, "Premium" for >15
- `age_group`: "Young" (18-30), "Middle" (31-50), "Mature" (51+)

## Problem 5
The following data is given to you:
```python
extended_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'user_id': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105],
    'genre': ['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi'],
    'watch_time': [45, 22, 50, 60, 30, 40, 35, 25, 55, 42],
    'subscription': ['premium', 'basic', 'premium', 'basic', 'premium', 'premium', 'basic', 'basic', 'premium', 'basic']
})
```

From the given data, create these plots:
1. A **scatterplot** showing the relationship between user_id (x-axis) and watch_time (y-axis). Color the points by subscription type using different colors for "basic" and "premium" subscribers. 
2. A **frequency bar chart** showing the frequency (count) of viewing sessions by genre. Use different colors for each genre bar for better readability.
3. A **histogram** showing the distribution of watch_time values. Use 6 bins and add edge colors to make the bars more distinct.
