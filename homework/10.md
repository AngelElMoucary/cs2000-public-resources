## Introduction
You'll analyze NYC housing development opportunities by working with 3 interconnected datasets to identify optimal locations for new housing. You'll evaluate these opportunities using key urban planning factors: proximity to schools for families and access to public transit for citywide connectivity.

You'll be working with 3 CSV files, 2 of which you've worked with before:

1. housing.csv, which you worked with in Homework 4 and 5 and has the following columns:
   - borough: The NYC borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island)
   - zipcode: ZIP code of the property
   - address: Street address of the property
   - landuse: Type of land use (residential, commercial, etc.)
   - ownertype: Category of property ownership
   - lotarea: Total lot area in square feet
   - bldgarea: Total building area in square feet
   - latitude: Latitude coordinate of the property
   - longitude: Longitude coordinate of the property
2. schools.csv, which you worked with in Homework 5 and has the following columns:
    - schoolname: Name of the school
    - latitude: Latitude coordinate of the school
    - longitude: Longitude coordinate of the school
    - address: Street address of the school
    - city: City in which the school is located
    - zip: ZIP code of the school
    - percentasian, percentblack, percenthispanic, percentblackhispanic, percentwhite: Demographics (as percentage strings like "16%")
3. stations.csv, which represents NYC subway stations:
   - division: Transit division (BMT, IRT, IND)
   - line: Subway line name  
   - stopname: Station name
   - latitude: Latitude of the station
   - longitude: Longitude of the station

## Problem 1
Load the NYC stations data from the CSV file into a table. Define a table called `stations-table` with the appropriate column names and types.

## Problem 2
Create structured data types to represent development opportunities and analyze public property using recursion with transit accessibility.

Define a data type called `PropertyOpportunity` that contains:
- address: String
- zipcode: String  
- lot-area: Number
- building-area: Number
- distance-to-school: Number
- distance-to-transit: Number
- is-public: Boolean

## Problem 3
### Part A
Design a function called `is-underutilized-public` that takes a row from the housing table and returns true if:
1. The owner type is "C" (city-owned) OR "O" (other public), and
2. The building area is less than 10% of the lot area (severely underutilized)

### Part B
Design a function `calculate-transit-distance` that takes property coordinates and returns the distance to the nearest subway station using the `simple-distance` function you defined in Homework 5.

### Part C
Create a function `row-to-opportunity` that converts a housing table row into a `PropertyOpportunity`, calculating distances to both schools and transit.

### Part D
Create a table `public-opportunities` that contains only the underutilized public properties from the housing table. Use the `is-underutilized-public` function you created in Part A to filter the data. Then, transform the public-opportunities table by adding columns for distance calculations in a new table called `opportunities-with-distances` that includes:
- All original columns from public-opportunities
- A school-distance column calculated using the distance to the center of schools
- A transit-distance column calculated using your `calculate-transit-distance` function

To visualize your data, create a scatterplot showing the relationship between school-distance (x-axis) and transit-distance (y-axis) for these underutilized public properties. This will help identify properties that are well-positioned relative to both schools and transit.

## Problem 4
### Part A
Define a data type called `MultiFamily` with:
- address: String
- zipcode: String
- building-area: Number
- transit-accessible: Boolean (within reasonable distance of subway)
 
### Part B
Design a function `is-transit-accessible` that takes property coordinates and returns true if the property is within 0.01 coordinate units of any subway station.

### Part C
Design a function `is-multifamily-residential` that returns true for landuse codes "02" or "03" (multi-family buildings).

## Part D
Design a recursive function `count-undervalued-near-transit` that takes your list of MultiFamily records and counts how many properties have both a tax-value-ratio < 0.5 (undervalued) AND are transit accessible.
