title: Homework 1 -- Flags

## Part One: Generating Flags

In this section, you will be creating four different flags: Botswana, Central African Republic, Greece, and Guyana.

> Note: Set up your code so that the four flags are output on the right hand
> side when we press the run button. Make sure nothing else is output (no
> sub-images, numbers, strings, or otherwise).

**Task 1**: Generate the flag of Botswana.

**Task 2**: Generate the flag of Central African Republic.

**Task 3**: Generate the flag of Greece.

**Task 4**: Generate the flag of Guyana.

> Make sure to use the solid color white to fill shapes where appropriate. Do
> not depend on the Pyret website's background to fill in white areas of your
> image.


> Reminder: Set up your code so that the four flags are output on the right hand
> side when we press the run button. Make sure nothing else is output (no
> sub-images, numbers, strings, or otherwise).

## Part Two: Practicing Program Planning

Most of the time, producing successful code requires thorough outlining and
planning. Program planning is a skill that can help you deconstruct a problem in
a way that allows you to avoid potential bugs. We now want to practice the
process of outlining code prior to coding.

**Task 5**: Pick one of the two images below. Without coding it, write a list of
steps and action items that describe, in words, how to recreate your image
(imagine that you were trying to get a child to draw the image from your steps)
starting from basic shapes. Use any terms you want to describe the steps: you
don't have to stick to names of operations that exist in Pyret or concepts that
we've covered in class.

Write your instructions between `#|` and `|#` in your homework file, which
indicates they are comments: ignored by Pyret, but readable by you, and your TAs!

> There is no lower or upper limit to how many steps you need to write. Try to
> make your instructions clear enough so that someone could replicate your image
> without having seen it.
