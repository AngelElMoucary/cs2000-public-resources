## Introduction
You're building a music streaming service called "TuneTracker". The system needs to manage playlists, track listening statistics, and analyze user preferences. Throughout this assignment, you'll explore how Python handles functions, variable mutation, and different types of equality in the context of music data.

## Problem 1
### Part A
Design a function `calculate_song_popularity` that takes three parameters:
1. play_count (int): Number of times the song has been played
2. likes (int): Number of likes the song has received
3. shares (int): Number of times the song has been shared

The function should return a popularity score using this formula:
- Play count contributes 60% of the score (normalized by dividing by 1000)
- Likes contribute 30% of the score (normalized by dividing by 100)
- Shares contribute 10% of the score (normalized by dividing by 10)

### Part B
Design a function `popularity_without_return` that performs the same calculation but does **NOT** use the `return` keyword. See what happens when you try to use this function's result in another expression.

## Problem 2
Design the function `total_listening_time` that takes a list of song durations (in seconds) and returns the total time.

## Problem 3
### Part A
Design a function `extend_songs_immutable` that adds 10 seconds to every song duration in a playlist, returning a new list without modifying the input.

### Part B
Design a function `extend_songs_mutable` that adds 10 seconds to every song duration in a playlist, modifying the input list directly using list indexing.

## Problem 4
Consider these two ways of creating identical playlists:
```python
playlist1 = ["Never Gonna Give You Up", "Clair de Lune", "Bohemian Rhapsody"]
playlist2 = ["Never Gonna Give You Up", "Clair de Lune", "Bohemian Rhapsody"]
playlist3 = playlist1
```

Design a function `test_playlist_equality` that demonstrates the difference between == (equality) and is (identity) using these playlists. The function should print comparison results and explanations.
