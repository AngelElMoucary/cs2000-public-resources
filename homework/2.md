## Introduction

Consider that we can use a number to represent seconds in a minute: any whole number from 0 to 59 (inclusive) is valid, but numbers above or below (or fractions or decimals) are not valid.

## Problem 1
Design a function, `tick`, that takes a number of seconds and returns the next second, as if a clock were ticking. Be sure that it does the right thing if given 59 seconds is input! Be sure to include a `doc:` string and test cases in a `where:` block!

## Problem 2
Design a function `seconds-to-image` that, given a number of seconds (a number between 0 and 59), produces an image of a timer with the seconds hand at the appropriate place -- i.e., an analog clock face with just a second hand. It's up to you how you would like it to look, but one way could be:

![Timer image example](/img/hw2-tick.png)

It's also not required for the hand to only extend from one side. i.e., it would be fine if your timer looked like this (for 15 & 45):

You do not need to provide any markings or numbers on the timer face, or to include test cases, but you should include a `doc:` string.

## Problem 3
You're designing a conference registration system, and one component of that is taking registration data and using it to construct conference badges that will be printed out for attendees to wear. 

**Please implement the following function. NOTE: you do not need to write test cases for this function, but please run it a few times in the interactions window to make sure the output looks good.**

```pyret
fun print-conference-badge(name :: String, gender :: String, email :: String, nuid :: String) -> Image:
  doc: "prints a conference attendee badge"
  # ...
end
```

## Problem 4
The previous problem asked you to print four pieces of information onto a badge: name, gender, email, and nuid. Please identify at least one way in which doing so would violate attendees' privacy. Please respond in at most two sentences.
