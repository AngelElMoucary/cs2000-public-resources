that is smaller -- 76 MB is too large. Maybe start by removing any row with
Owner Occupied as Y, since we are going to be looking at either public buildings
/ lots, multi family, etc. We should probably aim to get below 25MB -- and at
that point stick it in the git repo and start seeing how github dev is handling
it.

Could then try to do this task:

1. You will identify existing public property that is unused or underutilized using public tax records. 

2. Once it has been identified, you will visualize where it is.

3. And compute metrics of desirability for development â€” distance to public
   transit, to schools, etc.
