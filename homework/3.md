## Introduction
Bluebikes is a public bike share system in the Boston metropolitan area. In this assignment, you'll analyze trip data from the Bluebikes system to practice working with tables, filtering data, creating visualizations, and transforming columns.

For this assignment, you'll be working with a CSV file containing information about Bluebikes trips. The file "bluebikes-data.csv" contains the following columns:
- `duration`: Length of the trip in seconds
- `start-station-name`: Name of the station where the trip began
- `start-station-latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the starting station
- `start-station-longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the starting station
- `end-station-name`: Name of the station where the trip ended
- `end-station-latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the ending station
- `end-station-longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the ending station

## Problem 1
Load the Bluebikes data from the CSV file into a table. Define a table called `bike-table` with the appropriate column names and types 

## Problem 2
Many commuters use Bluebikes to travel between specific locations. Create a new table called `porter-square-trips` that contains only the trips that started at "Danehy Park" and ended at "Porter Square Station".

## Problem 3
Trip durations can vary widely. Design a function called `duration-category` that takes a row from the bike table and returns a string categorizing the trip duration as "short", "medium", or "long" based on the following criteria:
- "short": less than 300 seconds
- "medium": between 300 and 500 seconds (inclusive)
- "long": greater than 500 seconds

Include a proper `doc:` string that explains what the function does.

Then, use the `build-column` function to create a new table called `categorized-durations` that adds a "category" column to the original `bike-table`.

Finally, create a bar chart called `duration-bar-chart` that displays the frequency of each duration category.

## Problem 4
For better readability, it's often helpful to convert trip durations from seconds to minutes. Design a function called `seconds-to-minutes` that takes a number of seconds and returns the equivalent number of minutes. Include a `doc:` string and test cases in a `where:` block to demonstrate that your function works correctly.

Then, create a new table called `table-with-minutes` that replaces the "duration" column in the original `bike-table` with durations in minutes.
