## Introduction
You're working on a student information system for a university. The system uses lists to track various data about students, including their grades, course enrollments, and academic records. Throughout this assignment, you'll use recursive functions to process and analyze this student data.
Assume grades are represented as numbers (0-100), and student names are represented as strings.

## Problem 1
Design a function `contains-grade` that takes a list of grades and a target grade, and returns true if the target grade appears in the list, false otherwise.

## Problem 2
Design a function `sum-grades` that takes a list of grades and returns the total sum of all grades in the list. The sum of an empty list should be 0.

## Problem 3
Design a function `passing-grades` that takes a list of grades and returns a new list containing only grades that are passing grades, defined as grades that are 60 or above. The grades should appear in the same order as the original list.

## Problem 4
Design a function `nested-sum` that takes a list that may contain both numbers and other lists of numbers, and returns the sum of all numbers at any level. (elaine note: is this too hard?)

For example: `nested-sum([list: 1, [list: 2, 3], 4, [list: 5]])` should return 15.
