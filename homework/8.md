## Introduction

You're working on a student information system for a university. The system uses lists to track various data about students, including their grades, course enrollments, and academic records. Throughout this assignment, you'll use **recursive functions** to process and analyze this student data.

**DO NOT USE `for each` LOOPS!**

Assume grades are represented as numbers (0-100), and student names are represented as strings.

## Problem 1

Design a function `count-until-failing` that takes a list of grades and counts how many grades appear **BEFORE** the first failing grade (< 60). If there are no failing grades, return the total count of all grades.

## Problem 2

Design a function `valid-grade-sum` that takes a list of grades and returns the sum of all grades, but if any grade is invalid (negative or over 100), return -1 immediately without processing the rest.

## Problem 3

Design a function `grades-before-target` that takes a list of grades and a target grade, and returns a list of all grades that appear **BEFORE** the first occurrence of the target grade. If the target doesn't exist, return all grades.

## Problem 4

Design a function `nested-sum` that takes a list that may contain both numbers
or other lists of numbers or lists, and returns the sum of all numbers at any
level.

For example: `nested-sum([list: 1, [list: 2, 3], 4, [list: 5, [list: 2, 1]]])` should return 18.
