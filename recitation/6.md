## Working with for each Loops

To define our own list processing functions, we need a way to do computations for each element in the list. We'll use iteration with `for each()`.

This requires being able to modify variables, which in Pyret means they must be declared with `var`, and must be updated with the special operator `:=`.

**Pattern is:**

```pyret
var my-var = initial-value
for each(my-elt from my-list):
    # CODE IMPLEMENTATION HERE
end
my-var # Final result
```

**Example:** while `sum` is built in, we could have defined it ourselves as:

```pyret
fun my-sum(num-list :: List<Number>) -> Number block:
    var total = 0
    for each(n from num-list):
        total := total + n
    end
    total
    where:
    my-sum([list: 0, 1, 2, 3]) is 6
end
```

## Implementing Basic Functions

### Product Function

Define your own `product` function that takes a list of numbers and returns their product (multiply all of them together).

```pyret
fun my-product(num-list :: List<Number>) -> Number block:
    # YOUR CODE HERE
where:
    my-product([list: 2, 3, 4]) is 24
    my-product([list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is 120
end
```

### Length Function

Define a function `my-length` that takes a list of any value and returns the number of elements in the list.

```pyret
fun my-length(l :: List) -> Number block:
    # YOUR CODE HERE
where:
    my-length([list: "a", "b", "c"]) is 3
    my-length([list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is 5
    my-length([list: ]) is 0
end
```

## Finding Maximum Values

### Maximum Function

Define a function `my-max` that finds the largest number in a list.

```pyret
fun my-max(num-list :: List<Number>) -> Number block:
    # YOUR CODE HERE
where:
    my-max([list: 3, 7, 2, 9, 1]) is 9
    my-max([list: 5]) is 5
    my-max([list: -10, -5, -20]) is -5
end
```

Is there any issue with the choice of `initial-value` for this problem?

## Wrap-Up

What's the difference between `=` and `:=` in Pyret? When might you implement your own list functions instead of using built-ins?
