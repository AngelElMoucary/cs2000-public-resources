title: Recitation 4 -- Data Cleaning & Transformation
---


## [Outcomes](/outcomes/): 5

### **Objectives**
- Data cleaning
- Adding columns by computing from existing columns

## I. Introduction (5 minutes)
**Overview:** Explain that real-world data is rarely clean and ready to use. Students will work with a "messy" dataset of student survey responses about favorite foods, learning to clean and transform it into a usable format for analysis.

## II. Examining Messy Data (10 minutes)

### A. The Raw Dataset
Present students with this intentionally messy table:

```pyret
SURVEY-RAW = table: name, age, favorite-food, rating, state
    row: "Alice", "19", "pizza", "8", "MA"
    row: "Bob", "20", "PIZZA", "9", "ma"
    row: "Carol", "", "tacos", "7", "California"
    row: "David", "18", "Pizza", "ten", "Mass"
    row: "Eve", "21", "sushi", "", "MA"
    row: "Frank", "19", "ice cream", "6", "massachusetts"
    row: "Grace", "twenty", "Pizza", "8", "CA"
    row: "Henry", "19", "ICE CREAM", "5", "calif"
end
```

### B. Identifying Data Quality Issues
Have students examine the data and identify problems:
- **Inconsistent capitalization:** "pizza" vs "PIZZA" vs "Pizza"
- **Missing values:** Empty strings in age, rating columns
- **Inconsistent formats:** "twenty" vs "20", "ten" vs "10"
- **Inconsistent state abbreviations:** "MA" vs "ma" vs "Mass" vs "massachusetts"

**Discussion:** Ask, "What makes this data difficult to work with? What questions would be hard to answer?"

## III. Cleaning Text Data (15 minutes)

### A. Standardizing Case
Show students how to normalize text using string functions:

```pyret
food-normalized = build-column(SURVEY-RAW, "food-clean", lam(r): string-to-lower(r["favorite-food"]) end)
```

**Check Understanding:** Ask, "Why might we want all food names in lowercase?"

### B. Standardizing State Names
Create a more complex transformation for states:

```pyret
fun clean-state(state-input):
    doc: "convert various state formats to standard abbreviations"
    cleaned = string-to-lower(string-trim(state-input))
    if (cleaned == "ma") or (cleaned == "mass") or (cleaned == "massachusetts"):
        "MA"
    else if (cleaned == "ca") or (cleaned == "california") or (cleaned == "calif"):
        "CA"
    end
end

state-normalized = build-column(food-normalized, "state-clean", lam(r): clean-state(r["state"]) end)
```

**Discussion:**
Ask, "Why do we use `string-trim` and `string-to-lower` first?"

## IV. Handling Missing and Invalid Data (15 minutes)

### A. Dealing with Missing Ages
Show different strategies for missing numeric data:

```pyret
# Strategy 1: Filter out missing ages
complete-ages = filter-with(state-normalized, lam(r): not(r["age"] == "") end)

# Strategy 2: Replace missing ages with a default value
DEFAULT-AGE = 20

age-filled = build-column(state-normalized, "age-clean", lam(r):
    if r["age"] == "":
        DEFAULT-AGE
    else:
        string-to-number(r["age"])
    end
end)
```

**Discussion:** Ask, "When might you choose between filtering vs. filling missing data?"

### B. Converting Text Numbers to Actual Numbers
Handle the mixed numeric/text rating problem:

```pyret
fun clean-rating(rating-input):
    doc: "converts rating to number, handling text entries"
    if rating-input == "":
        -1
    else if rating-input == "ten":
        10
    else if rating-input == "nine":
        9
    else if rating-input == "eight":
        8
    else:
        string-to-number(rating-input)
    end
end

ratings-cleaned = build-column(age-filled, "rating-clean", lam(r): clean-rating(r["rating"]) end)
```

**Check Understanding:** Ask, "Why should we use -1 for missing ratings instead of 0?"

## V. Computing New Columns (10 minutes)

### Creating Derived Data
Add computed columns based on existing data:

```pyret
# Add ratings category column
final-table = build-column(ratings-cleaned, "rating-category", lam(r):
    rating = r["rating-clean"]
    if rating == -1:
        "no-rating"
    else if rating >= 8:
        "high"
    else if rating >= 6:
        "medium" 
    else:
        "low"
    end
end)
```
## VI. Recap and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)
### Key Points Discussion:
- **Incremental Cleaning:** Building columns step by step rather than trying to fix everything at once
- **Trade-offs:** Different strategies for missing data have different implications

### Reflection Questions:
- "How did adding computed columns make the data more useful?"
- "What would happen if we tried to analyze the original messy data?"
