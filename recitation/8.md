## Skills: [5](/skills/#(5))

## Reading: [5.3](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/recursive-data.html)

### **Objectives**
- Understand the recursive structure of lists (first and rest)
- Apply the recursive template to write list processing functions
- Use pattern matching with `cases` for recursive list functions

## I. Introduction (5 minutes)
Recap that students now know about structured and conditional data, and that lists are a kind of structured data with two parts: a first element and the rest (which is itself a list). Although we've computed with lists using for loops, another approach is to process lists recursively.

## II. Discovering Patterns Through Examples (15 minutes)

### A. Example 1: Computing the Count of Elements (`my-count`)
**Step-by-Step Examples:**
- *Case 1:* `my-count(empty)` is 0
- *Case 2:* `my-count([list: 7])` is 1  
- *Case 3:* `my-count([list: 3, 8, 5])` is 3
  - Notice: The first element is 3, and the rest is `[list: 8, 5]`, which has count 2
  - So we can say: `my-count([list: 3, 8, 5])` is `1 + my-count([list: 8, 5])`

An empty list has count 0, and a non-empty list's count is 1 plus the count of its rest.

### B. Example 2: Finding the Total of Elements (`my-total`)
**Step-by-Step Examples:**
- *Case 1:* `my-total(empty)` is 0
- *Case 2:* `my-total([list: 6])` is 6
- *Case 3:* `my-total([list: 6, 4, 2])` is 6 + (total of `[list: 4, 2]`), which is 6 + 6 = 12

For a non-empty list, the total equals the first element plus the total of the rest.

Emphasize that these examples demonstrate how the answer for a whole list can be expressed in terms of the first element and the answer for the rest.

## III. From Examples to Code (15 minutes)
If the list is empty, return the "base case" value. If the list is non-empty, then combine the first element with the recursive call on the rest.

### A. Writing the Code for `my-count`
```pyret
fun my-count(l :: List<Any>) -> Number:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty => 0
    | link(f, r) => 1 + my-count(r)
  end
where:
  my-count(empty) is 0
  my-count([list: 7]) is 1
  my-count([list: 3, 8, 5]) is 3
end
```

### B. Writing the Code for `my-total`
```pyret
fun my-total(l :: List<Number>) -> Number:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty => 0
    | link(f, r) => f + my-total(r)
  end
where:
  my-total(empty) is 0
  my-total([list: 6]) is 6
  my-total([list: 6, 4, 2]) is 12
end
```

## IV. The General Recursive Template (10 minutes)
Write the general pattern:

```pyret
fun function-name(l :: List<T>) -> R:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty => <base-case-expression>
    | link(first, rest) => <combine first and recursive call on rest>
  end
end
```

**Explanation:**
- The input list `l` is of type `List<T>` (where `T` is the type of the elements)
- The function returns a value of type `R`
- For the empty list, we return a base case
- For a non-empty list, we combine the first element with the result of processing the rest

## V. Practice with the Template (10 minutes)

### Writing a Filter Function
Write a recursive function that keeps only even numbers from a list:

```pyret
fun my-evens(l :: List<Number>) -> List<Number>:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty => empty
    | link(f, r) =>
      if num-modulo(f, 2) == 0:
        link(f, my-evens(r))
      else:
        my-evens(r)
      end
  end
where:
  my-evens(empty) is empty
  my-evens([list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is [list: 2, 4]
end
```

## VI. Recap and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

### Key Points Discussion:
- **Recursive Structure:** Every list is either empty or has a first element and a rest
- **Base Case:** What to return for an empty list
- **Recursive Case:** How to combine the first element with the result of processing the rest
- **Template Pattern:** Most list recursion follows the same structure with `cases`

### Reflection Questions:
- "When might recursion be cleaner than using a for-loop?"
- "What happens if you forget the base case in a recursive function?
