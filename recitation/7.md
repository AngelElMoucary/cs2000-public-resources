## Reading: [6.1](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/intro-struct-data.html), [6.2](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/Collections_of_Structured_Data.html)

### **Objectives**
- Define and create structured data types
- Extract fields from structured data
- Define and create conditional data types with multiple variants
---

## Part 1: Structured Data

### I. Introduction (5 minutes)
Explain that many pieces of real-world information consist of several parts that should be kept together. Introduce the idea of structured dataâ€”data that bundles multiple fields into a single value.

**Example:** A student record system where each student has a name, ID number, and GPA.

### II. Defining and Creating Structured Data (10 minutes)

### A. Defining a Structured Data Type
Introduce a new data type called `Student` to represent a student:

```pyret
data Student:
  | student(name :: String, id :: Number, gpa :: Number)
end
```

### B. Creating Examples
Create instances of `Student` using the constructor `student`:

```pyret
alice = student("Alice Smith", 12345, 3.7)
bob = student("Bob Martinez", 23456, 3.2)
carol = student("Carol Johnson", 34567, 3.9)
```

**Discussion:** Ask, "What do you expect to happen if you try to create a student with a string for the ID number?"

### III. Programming with Structured Data (15 minutes)

### A. Extracting Fields
Write a function `student-info` that returns a formatted string for a student:

```pyret
fun student-info(s :: Student) -> String:
  s.name + " (ID: " + num-to-string(s.id) + ") - GPA: " + num-to-string(s.gpa)
end
```

**Check Understanding:** Ask, "What is the result of `student-info(alice)`?"
Expected output: `"Alice Smith (ID: 12345) - GPA: 3.7"`

### B. Writing Functions with Structured Data
Write a function `honors-student` that returns true if a student has a GPA of 3.5 or higher:

```pyret
fun honors-student(s :: Student) -> Boolean:
  s.gpa >= 3.5
where:
  honors-student(alice) is true
  honors-student(bob) is false
  honors-student(carol) is true
end
```

## Part 2: Conditional Data

### IV. Introduction (5 minutes)
Explain that sometimes data can come in multiple forms and that we need a way to represent alternatives within one type. Introduce the idea of conditional data -- data that can be one of several variants.

**Example:** A food delivery system where an order can be for pickup, delivery to an address, or curbside pickup.

### V. Defining and Creating Conditional Data (15 minutes)

### A. Defining a Conditional Data Type
Define a new type called `OrderType` with three variants:

```pyret
data OrderType:
  | pickup
  | delivery(address :: String, tip :: Number)
  | curbside(car-color :: String, license-plate :: String)
end
```

**Check Understanding:** Ask, "How many different ways can someone receive their order according to our OrderType?"

### B. Creating Examples
Create instances of `OrderType`:

```pyret
order-1 = pickup
order-2 = delivery("360 Huntington Ave, Boston MA", 5.00)
order-3 = curbside("red", "ABC123")
```

### VI. Programming with Conditional Data (15 minutes)

### A. Taking Apart Variants with `cases`
Write a function `order-instructions` that returns instructions for fulfilling an order:

```pyret
fun order-instructions(o :: OrderType) -> String:
  cases (OrderType) o:
    | pickup => "Order ready for pickup at counter"
    | delivery(addr, tip-amount) => "Deliver to " + addr + " (tip: $" + num-to-string(tip-amount) + ")"
    | curbside(color, plate) => "Look for " + color + " car with plate " + plate + " in parking lot"
  end
where:
  order-instructions(pickup) is "Order ready for pickup at counter"
  order-instructions(order-3) is "Look for red car with plate ABC123 in parking lot"
end
```

### B. Processing Fields in Variants
Write a function `total-cost` that calculates the total cost including any service fees:

```pyret
fun total-cost(base-cost :: Number, o :: OrderType) -> Number:
  cases (OrderType) o:
    | pickup => base-cost
    | delivery(addr, tip-amount) => base-cost + 3.00 + tip-amount # $3 delivery fee
    | curbside(color, plate) => base-cost + 1.50 # $1.50 curbside fee
  end
where:
  total-cost(15.00, pickup) is 15.00
  total-cost(15.00, delivery("360 Huntington Ave", 4.00)) is 22.00
  total-cost(15.00, curbside("blue", "XYZ789")) is 16.50
end
```

**Discussion:** Ask, "What information do we use and ignore in each case?"

## VII. Recap and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

### Key Points Discussion:
- **Structured Data:** Bundles multiple related fields into a single value using dot notation for field access
- **Conditional Data:** Represents data that can take multiple forms using variants
- **Pattern Matching:** Use `cases` to handle different variants and extract their fields

### Reflection Questions:
- "When would you use structured data instead of separate variables?"
- "Why is pattern matching with `cases` better than using if-statements for conditional data?"
