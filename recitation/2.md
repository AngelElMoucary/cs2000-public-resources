title: Recitation 2 -- Functions & Conditionals
---

## [Outcomes](/outcomes/): 2.1, 3.1

### **Objectives**
- Practice defining functions and constants in Pyret.
- Incrementally build a distance function using FCC approximation formula.
- Use real-world coordinate data (from Google Maps) to test the function.
- Discover and correct a unit conversion error when the computed value does not match the expected value.

---

### **I. Introduction (5 minutes)**
- **Overview:**
  Explain that today students will write a function to compute the distance between two points given by latitude and longitude using an approximate formula provided by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

---

### **II. Setting Up the Problem (10 minutes)**
#### **A. Choosing Two Points**
- **Activity:**
  Have each student or group select two landmarks (using Google Maps) that are approximately 1 mile apart according to "measure distance" function (right/ctrl click to use it).
  They should record the latitude and longitude for each point.
- **Defining Constants:**
  Students define their chosen points. For example:
  ```pyret
  POINT-A-LAT = 42.3505
  POINT-A-LON = -71.1054

  POINT-B-LAT = 42.3430
  POINT-B-LON = -71.1020
  ```
  (Students should use the coordinates they find.)

#### **B. Writing a Helper Function: deg-to-rad**
- **Explanation:**
  The FCC approximation formulas use trigonometric functions, and Pyret's require angles to be in radians, whereas latitude & longitude are in degrees.
- **Activity:**
  Have students write a function to convert from degrees to radians:
  ```pyret
  fun deg-to-rad(deg):
    PI = ~3.141592653589793
    (2 * PI * deg) / 360
  end
  ```
- **Check Understanding:**
  Ask, “How does this function convert an angle from degrees to radians?”

---

### **III. Developing FCC Constants (10 minutes)**
#### **A. Choosing a Reference Latitude**
- **Activity:**
  Let students define a reference latitude using the average of their points:
  ```pyret
  REF-LAT = (POINT-A-LAT + POINT-B-LAT) / 2
  ```
#### **B. Computing the Conversion Factors**
- Write out these formulae on the board, in normal math, without the deg-to-rad conversion. Students should translate it into code, e.g.:
- **For Latitude (KPDLAT):**
  ```pyret
  KPDLAT = (111.13209 - (0.56605 * num-cos(deg-to-rad(2 * REF-LAT))))
            + (0.00120 * num-cos(deg-to-rad(4 * REF-LAT)))
  ```
- **For Longitude (KPDLON):**
  ```pyret
  KPDLON = (111.41513 - num-cos(deg-to-rad(REF-LAT))
            - (0.09455 * num-cos(deg-to-rad(3 * REF-LAT))))
            + (0.00012 * num-cos(deg-to-rad(5 * REF-LAT)))
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  Walk through the formulas, asking:
  - “What is the role of these constants?”
  - “How do they help convert differences in degrees into distances?”

---

### **IV. Building the Distance Function Incrementally (20 minutes)**
#### **A. Writing the Function Header and Documentation**
- **Activity:**
  Ask students to define a function called `dist` that computes the distance between two points, given the following signature & docstring:
  ```pyret
  fun dist(lat1 :: Number, lat2 :: Number, lon1 :: Number, lon2 :: Number):
    doc: "Calculates the distance between two coordinates using FCC approximation"
  ```
#### **B. Step 1: Compute Scaled Differences**
- **Activity:**
  Have students compute the differences scaled by the FCC constants:
  ```pyret
    NS = KPDLAT * (lat1 - lat2)
    EW = KPDLON * (lon1 - lon2)
  ```
- **Prompt:**
  “What do these variables (NS and EW) represent?”

#### **C. Step 2: Compute the Euclidean Distance**
- **Activity:**
  Next, compute the raw distance using the Pythagorean theorem:
  ```pyret
    num-sqrt(num-sqr(NS) + num-sqr(EW))
  end
  ```

#### **D. Step 3: Writing a Test Case**
- **Scenario:**
  Explain that the two points were chosen to be about 1 mile apart.
- **Activity:**
  Ask students to add a test case using a *where* clause. For example:
  ```pyret
  fun dist(lat1, lat2, lon1, lon2):
    doc: "Calculates the distance between two coordinates using FCC approximation"
    NS = KPDLAT * (lat1 - lat2)
    EW = KPDLON * (lon1 - lon2)
    num-sqrt(num-sqr(NS) + num-sqr(EW))
  where:
    dist(POINT-A-LAT, POINT-B-LAT, POINT-A-LON, POINT-B-LON) is%(within(0.1)) 1
  end
  ```
- Explain that numeric calculations using decimal numbers will often have small
  inaccuracies, so tests will work better if they test that the output is not
  equal, but rather, within a certain bound of the expected value. Pyret's `is`
  can be followed by `%()` and then a testing predicate can be placed within the
  parentheses: the most common one is `within(N)` where `N` is some number. This
  checks that the output is `1 +- 0.1`, i.e., that it is greater than `0.9` and
  less than `1.1`.
  
- **Observation:**
  When students run the test, many will notice that the computed value does not match the expected value of 1.

#### **E. Discovering the Unit Mismatch**
- **Prompt Discussion:**
  Ask:
  - “If our FCC formulas produce a result based on our constants, why might the computed value be different from 1?”
  - "If tests fail, either the code is wrong or the tests are wrong. Which is the case here?"
  - “Could it be that our function is returning a value in a different _unit_ than expected?”
- **Guided Reasoning:**
  Lead students to consider that the FCC formulas yield a value (approximately 1.609) that is not 1—because the output produced a number that was not in miles!

#### **F. Step 4: Correcting the Function to Return the Expected Value**
- **Activity:**
  Explain that to match the test case (which expects 1), the function must convert the computed value. Ask:
  - “What conversion might we need if the computed value is, say, 1.609 when we expect 1?”
- **Solution:**
  Lead students to recall that 1 mile is approximately 1.60934 KM. Have them update the function by dividing the raw distance by 1.60934:
  ```pyret
  fun dist(lat1, lat2, lon1, lon2):
    doc: "Calculates the distance between two coordinates using FCC approximations"
    NS = KPDLAT * (lat1 - lat2)
    EW = KPDLON * (lon1 - lon2)
    num-sqrt(num-sqr(NS) + num-sqr(EW)) / 1.60934
  where:
    dist(POINT-A-LAT, POINT-B-LAT, POINT-A-LON, POINT-B-LON) is%(within(0.1)) 1
  end
  ```
- **Test Again:**
  Instruct students to run the updated function. They should now see a value that passes the test.

### **V. Recap and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)**
- **Key Points Discussion:**
  - **Incremental Development:**
    How breaking the problem into parts (helper function, constants, raw computation) helped manage complexity.
  - **Testing and Debugging:**
    How a test case using real-world data (the two points chosen to be 1 mile apart) revealed the unit mismatch.
- **Reflection Questions:**
  - “How did our test case help you find the error?”
- **Units Matter**
  - In 1999, a space probe was lost because of failure to correctly convert between units! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter
