### Calculating Distance -- Test First
- Have each student or group select two landmarks (using Google Maps) that are approximately 1 mile apart according to "measure distance" function (right/ctrl click to use it).
  They should record the latitude and longitude for each point.
- Students define their chosen points. For example:
  ```pyret
  POINT-A-LAT = 42.3505
  POINT-A-LON = -71.1054

  POINT-B-LAT = 42.3430
  POINT-B-LON = -71.1020
  ```
  (Students should use the coordinates they find.)

### Write a Helper Function: deg-to-rad**
- The FCC approximation formula we will use to calculate
  distance use trigonometric functions, and Pyret's require angles to be in
  radians, whereas latitude & longitude are in degrees.
- Have students write a function to convert from degrees to radians. Remember, 2
  PI is the same as 360 degrees. The constant `PI` is built in to Pyret.

### Developing FCC Constants 
- Students should define a reference latitude using the average of their points
  `POINT-A-LAT` and `POINT-B-LAT`.
- Now, students should compute two constants, `KPDLAT` and `KPDLON`. Reference page 3 of https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2016-title47-vol4/pdf/CFR-2016-title47-vol4-sec73-208.pdf, noting `ML` is the reference latitude just defined, and be sure to convert to radians before using Pyret's `num-cos` function.

### Building the Distance Function
- Given the following function header:
  ```pyret
  fun dist(lat1 :: Number, lat2 :: Number, lon1 :: Number, lon2 :: Number):
    doc: "Calculates the distance between two coordinates using FCC approximation"
  ```
  define a function to calculate the distance. The key is that north-south distance is the difference of latitudes multiplied by `KPDLAT` and the east-west distance is the difference in longitudes multiplied by `KPDLON`, and then the pythagorean theorem can get the actual distance.

#### Writing a Test Case
- At the beginning, we found two points that we chose to be 1 mile apart --
  let's write a test using those points:
  ```pyret
  fun dist(lat1, lat2, lon1, lon2):
    doc: "Calculates the distance between two coordinates using FCC approximation"
    ...
  where:
    dist(POINT-A-LAT, POINT-B-LAT, POINT-A-LON, POINT-B-LON) is%(within(0.1)) 1
  end
  ```
- Numeric calculations using decimal numbers will often have small
  inaccuracies, so tests will work better if they test that the output is not
  equal, but rather, within a certain bound of the expected value. Pyret's `is`
  can be followed by `%()` and then a testing predicate can be placed within the
  parentheses: the most common one is `within(N)` where `N` is some number. This
  checks that the output is `1 +- 0.1`, i.e., that it is greater than `0.9` and
  less than `1.1`.
- Run the test -- what do you see?

#### Discovering the Bug
- If our FCC formulas produce a result based on our constants, why might the computed value be different from 1?
- If tests fail, either the code is wrong or the tests are wrong. Which is the case here?
- What is the value that is produced? (Approximately 1.609). What is the relationship between 1.609 and 1? 
- Once you figure out the bug, go back and fix the issue in the code! Re-run to
  confirm that the bug has been fixed.

### Wrap-Up
- Breaking the problem into parts (helper function, constants, raw computation) helped manage complexity.
- Test cases (e.g., using real-world data -- two points chosen to be 1 mile apart) revealed the a bug (unit mismatch).
- In 1999, a space probe was lost because of failure to correctly convert between units! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter
