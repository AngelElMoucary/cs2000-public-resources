## [Outcomes](/outcomes/): None

## **Suggested Recitation Flow**

1. **Warm‐Up (5–10 minutes)**
   - Solve **Problem 1 (T-Shirt Shop Math)** to review spacing and parentheses.
2. **Strings Practice (5 minutes)**
   - Try **Problem 2 (String Surprises)** to see different string errors.
3. **Hands‐On Image Work (15–20 minutes)**
   - Go through  **Problem 3 (Traffic Light)** for layering shapes.
4. **Error Debugging (10 minutes)**
   - Look at **Problem 4 (Broken Code Hunt)** to interpret type mismatch issues.
5. **Creative Builds (20 minutes)**
   - Try **Problem 5 (Flag or Shield)** or a personal variation.

## **Problem Set**

### **1. T-Shirt Shop Math**

**Goal:** Practice arithmetic expressions and order of operations.

1. **Calculating Cost**
   - You sell custom T-shirt designs for \$12 each. However, every design requires a \$3 setup fee.
   - Write an **expression** to calculate the total cost for **5** T-shirts.
   - Then, write a second expression for **7** T-shirts.
   - Compare the results.
   *Hint:* Use parentheses where needed: `(12 * 5) + 3`, etc.

2. **Rectangular Poster**
   - You also print posters. A client wants a **24" by 36"** poster. The price is based on the **perimeter** of the poster times \$0.10.
   - First, **compute** the perimeter with an expression (remember `Perimeter = 2 * (width + height)`).
   - Then, multiply that perimeter by `0.10` to find the cost.
   - What happens if you forget parentheses around `(width + height)`?

### **2. String Surprises**

**Goal:** Experiment with strings.

1. **Saving a Tagline**
   - Your T-shirt shop’s tagline is: **“Designs for everyone!”**
   - Type it into Pyret as a string.
   - Now **omit** one of the quotes and see the error.
   - **Fix** the error so your string prints correctly.

2. **Color Inventory**
   - You keep track of colors as strings. For instance: `"red"`, `"blue"`, `"gold"`.
   - What happens if you try to `+` them (e.g. `"red" + "blue"`)?
   - **Reflect**: `+` works on both numbers and strings. What happens if you do `1 + "blue"`?

### **3. Make a Traffic Light**

**Goal:** Practice layering shapes in a new way.

1. **Frame**
   - Start with a **solid black rectangle** that is tall and narrow (e.g., `rectangle(40, 100, "solid", "black")`). This will be the traffic light’s body.

2. **Lights**
   - Overlay three **colored circles** (red, yellow, green) **on top** of that rectangle, spaced in a vertical stack.
   - You may do this by carefully using `above` with each circle and overlaying them onto the rectangle.
   - Alternatively, overlay them one by one in the correct positions if you’re comfortable with more advanced layering.

3. **Challenge**
   - Can you add a small rectangular “pole” at the bottom?
   - How might you use `above` or `beside` to position the pole?

---

### **4. Broken Code Hunt**

**Goal:** Identify type mismatches or wrong arguments.

Each of these snippets has an **error**. Try them in Pyret, read the error message, and **fix** it.

1.
   ```pyret
   # Goal: A rectangle with width 50 and height 20, solid black
   rectangle(50, "solid", 20, "black")
   ```
   - **Hint**: Check the **order** and **types** of arguments that `rectangle` expects.

2.
   ```pyret
   # Trying to combine a number and a text string
   5 + "Thanks"
   ```
   - **Hint**: Notice what type `+` needs for both operands.

3.
   ```pyret
   # Oops, forgot a quote?
   circle(30, solid, "red")
   ```
   - **Hint**: The second argument must be a string (`"solid"` or `"outline"`).

---

### **5. Create a Flag or Shield**

**Goal:** Encourage creative composition.

1. **Flag Design**
   - Invent a simple **flag** using **at least three shapes**.
   - For instance, many flags have stripes (rectangles) above or beside each other, or shapes overlaid in the center.
   - *Example steps*:
     - Make one large rectangle as the background.
     - Overlay a smaller shape (circle, star, or rectangle) in the upper left.
     - Possibly add a vertical stripe on the right side.

2. **Shield Variation**
   - Alternatively, make a **shield** shape (maybe a rotated square to get a diamond) overlaid with a circle or star.
   - Try out `rotate(45, square(100, "solid", "gray"))` to get a diamond shape.
   - Layer shapes on top of it for an emblem.

3. **Share**
   - Show your neighbor.
   - If time allows, label your shapes with text (e.g., `overlay(text("Go!", 20, "black"), your-shield)`).
