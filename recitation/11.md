title: Recitation 11 -- Variable Scoping and Mutable Data
---

### **Objectives**
- Understand the program directory mental model for variable scoping
- Compare Python and Pyret approaches to variable declaration and mutation
- Work with mutable data structures and understand aliasing
- Distinguish between structural and reference equality

## I. Introduction (5 minutes)
The "program directory" is our mental model of how a language keeps track of variable names and their associated values. Both Python and Pyret use this concept, but with key differences.

**Key Differences:**
- **Pyret:** Must choose mutable (`var x = 5`) vs immutable (`x = 5`) at declaration
- **Python:** Assignment `=` both creates and updates variables

## II. Python Variable Scoping (15 minutes)

### A. Global vs Local Bindings
**Example 1: Global Assignment**

```python
score = 100 # score is bound in the global directory

def show_score():
    return score

print(show_score()) # prints 100
```

The function `show_score` looks up `score` in the global directory.

**Example 2: Local Binding and Shadowing**

```python
score = 100

def change_score():
    score = 50 # creates NEW local variable, doesn't change global
    return score

print(change_score()) # prints 50
print(score) # prints 100 -- global unchanged
```

### B. Using Global and Nonlocal
**Example 3: Actually Updating Global**

```python
score = 100

def update_global_score():
    global score # explicitly refer to global variable
    score = 75

update_global_score()
print(score) # prints 75
```

**Example 4: Nested Functions**

```python
def outer():
    count = 10
    def inner():
        nonlocal count # refer to count from outer function
        count = count + 5
    inner()
    return count

print(outer()) # prints 15
```

## III. Pyret Variable Scoping (15 minutes)

### A. Immutable vs Mutable Declarations
**Example 1: Immutable Declaration**

```pyret
x = 10
# x is immutable - this would cause an error:
# x := 20
```

**Example 2: Mutable Declaration**

```pyret
var x = 10
x := x + 5 # x becomes 15
x # returns 15
```

**Check Understanding:** Ask, "What's the difference between `=` and `:=` in Pyret?"

### B. No Accidental Shadowing
In Pyret, once a name is declared in a scope, re-declaring that same name is forbidden. This prevents accidental shadowing.

**Example:**

```pyret
y = 20
# This would cause an error in Pyret:
# y = 30 (can't re-declare y)

# But this works:
var z = 20
z := 30 # explicit update
```

### C. Program Directory Comparison
**Discussion using Program Directory Model:**

**Pyret:**
- `var x = 10` records `x` as mutable in directory
- `x := 20` directly changes that entry
- `x = 50` after declaration causes error (name already exists)

**Python:**
- `x = 10` at global level adds `x` to global directory
- Inside function, `x = 50` creates new local entry
- Global `x` unchanged unless using `global x`

## IV. Memory Model (5 minutes)
We expand our program directory model to include a "heap" -- where mutable structured data lives.

**Mental Model:**
- **Program Directory:** Maps names to values (or addresses for structured data)
- **Heap:** Stores structured data objects with unique addresses

**Example:**
- Directory: `book1 -> @1001`
- Heap: `@1001: LibraryBook("Python Guide", 3)`

## V. Student Record Example (20 minutes)

### A. Data Design
Each student has an ID, name, and current credit hours. We want to update credits when they register for courses.

### B. Python Version
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class StudentRecord:
    id: int
    name: str
    credits: int

student1 = StudentRecord(12345, "Alice Smith", 15)

student1.credits = student1.credits + 3 # registered for 3-credit course
print(student1.credits) # prints 18
```

Python doesn't require special syntax -- all fields are mutable by default.

### C. Pyret Version
```pyret
data StudentRecord:
  student-record(id :: Number,
                name :: String,
                ref credits :: Number) # ref marks as mutable
end

student1 = student-record(12345, "Alice Smith", 15)

# Access mutable field with !
student1!credits # returns current credits

# Update credits using special syntax
student1!{credits: student1!credits + 3}
student1!credits # now returns 18
```

**Key Differences:**
- Mutable fields marked with `ref`
- Access with `!` instead of `.`
- Update with `!{field: new-value}` syntax


## VI. Aliasing and the Heap (15 minutes)
Aliasing occurs when two names refer to the same object (same heap address).

**Python Example:**
```python
student1 = StudentRecord(12345, "Alice Smith", 15)
student2 = student1 # aliasing -- both refer to same object

student1.credits = student1.credits + 3
print(student2.credits) # prints 18
```

**Pyret Example:**
```pyret
student1 = student-record(12345, "Alice Smith", 15)
student2 = student1 # aliasing

student1!{credits: student1!credits + 3}
student2!credits # returns 18
```

**Program Directory/Heap Visualization:**
```
Directory:
student1 → @1001
student2 → @1001 # Same address

Heap:
@1001: StudentRecord(12345, "Alice Smith", 18)
```

## VII. Equality: Structural vs Reference (10 minutes)

### A. Two Types of Equality
**Structural Equality:** Same contents in all fields
**Reference Equality:** Same object in memory (same heap address)

### B. Examples with Student Records
```python
alice1 = StudentRecord(100, "Alice", 15)
alice2 = StudentRecord(100, "Alice", 15) # same content, different object
alice3 = alice1 # alias

# Structural equality (==)
print(alice1 == alice2) # True -- same contents
print(alice1 == alice3) # True -- same contents

# Reference equality (is)
print(alice1 is alice2) # False -- different objects
print(alice1 is alice3) # True -- same object (alias)
```

### C. Mutation Effects on Equality
```python
alice1.credits = 18 # update through one alias

print(alice1 == alice2) # now False -- different contents
print(alice1 is alice3) # still True -- same object
print(alice1.credits == alice3.credits) # True -- both show 18
```

## VIII. Recap and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

### Key Points Discussion:
- **Program Directory:** Mental model for tracking variable names and values
- **Python Scoping:** `=` both declares and updates; use `global`/`nonlocal` for outer scope access
- **Pyret Scoping:** Explicit mutable (`var`) vs immutable declarations; no accidental shadowing
- **Mutable Data:** Pyret requires `ref` marking; Python makes all fields mutable
- **Aliasing:** Multiple names can refer to same object; changes affect all aliases
- **Equality:** Structural (`==`) vs reference (`is`) equality in Python

### Reflection Questions:
- "Why is understanding aliasing important when working with mutable data?"
