## Working with Lists

Here's some cafe sales data:

```pyret
cafe-data = table: day, drinks-sold
    row: "Mon", 45
    row: "Tue", 30
    row: "Wed", 55
    row: "Thu", 40
    row: "Fri", 60
end
```

### Extracting Lists from Tables

Extract the drinks-sold column as a list using `get-column`. What does this list look like? How is it different from the original table?

### Mathematical Operations on Lists

You'll need to import the math and statistics libraries:

```pyret
import math as M
import statistics as S
```

Using the extracted list, find:

- The maximum number of drinks sold (use `M.max`)
- The minimum number of drinks sold (use `M.min`)
- The average daily sales (use `S.mean`)
- The total weekly sales (use `M.sum`)

### Creating List Literals

Create these lists directly (without using a table):

- A list of test scores: 85, 92, 78, 96, 88, 91
- An empty list
- A list of names: "Alice", "Bob", "Carol"

Using your test scores list, calculate:

- The highest score (use `M.max`)
- The average score (use `S.mean`)
- The total of all scores (use `M.sum`)

### Transforming Lists with Map

You'll need to import the lists library:

```pyret
import lists as L
```

Convert these Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40

The formula is: (celsius × 9/5) + 32

Use `L.map` with a function that applies this formula to each temperature.

### Working with Student Grades

Given these raw scores: 78, 85, 92, 67, 88, 94, 73, 81, 90, 86

Apply a 5-point curve to all scores using `L.map` with a lambda function that adds 5 to each score.

Then convert the curved scores to letter grades using `L.map` with a lambda function that checks the score ranges:

- A: 90 and above
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: below 60

How many students got each letter grade?

### Finding Unique Values

Use `L.distinct` to find all the unique letter grades that were assigned.

### Filtering Lists

Use `L.filter` with a lambda function to find all the passing scores (60 and above) from your curved scores list. How many students passed?

## Wrap-Up

When would you use a list instead of a table? What real-world data could you analyze using these list operations?
