## [Outcomes](/outcomes/): 

### **Objectives**
- List literals
- Math operations on lists: max, sum, mean
- Transforming lists with map & lambda

## I. Introduction (5 minutes)
**Overview:** Explain that students will learn to work with listsâ€”ordered collections of data that can be extracted from table columns or created directly. They'll use built-in mathematical operations and transformations to analyze cafe sales data and other real-world scenarios.

## II. Extracting Lists from Tables (15 minutes)

### A. The Cafe Sales Dataset
Present students with this cafe tracking data:

```pyret
cafe-data =
  table: day, drinks-sold
    row: "Mon", 45
    row: "Tue", 30
    row: "Wed", 55
    row: "Thu", 40
    row: "Fri", 60
  end
```

**Discussion:** Explain that we often want to ask statistical questions like:
- What's the maximum number of drinks sold?
- What's the average sold per day?
- What's the total sold this week?

### B. Extracting Columns as Lists
Show students how to extract data for analysis:

```pyret
import math as M
import statistics as S

sales = cafe-data.get-column("drinks-sold")
```

**Check Understanding:** Ask, "What does the extracted list look like? How is it different from a table?"

### C. Mathematical Operations on Lists
Demonstrate basic operations:

```pyret
M.max(sales) # Find maximum sales day
M.min(sales) # Find minimum sales day  
S.mean(sales) # Calculate average daily sales
M.sum(sales) # Calculate total weekly sales
```

## III. Creating List Literals (10 minutes)

### A. Direct List Creation
Show students how to create lists without tables:

```pyret
test-scores = [list: 85, 92, 78, 96, 88, 91]
empty-list = [list: ]
names = [list: "Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
```

**Check Understanding:** Ask, "What types of data can lists contain?"

### B. Practice with Basic Operations
Have students work with their test scores:

```pyret
highest = M.max(test-scores)

average = S.mean(test-scores)

total = M.sum(test-scores)
```

## IV. Transforming Lists with Map (10 minutes)

### Introduction to Map
Introduce the concept of transforming every element:

```pyret
import lists as L

temps-celsius = [list: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40]

fun celsius-to-fahrenheit(c):
  (c * 9/5) + 32
end

temps-fahrenheit = L.map(celsius-to-fahrenheit, temps-celsius)
```

**Check Understanding:** Ask, "What does map do to each element in the list?"

## V. Combining Operations (15 minutes)

### A. Working with Student Grade Data
Present a more complex scenario:

```pyret
raw-scores = [list: 78, 85, 92, 67, 88, 94, 73, 81, 90, 86]

# Apply a 5-point curve to all scores
curved-scores = L.map(lam(score): score + 5 end, raw-scores)

letter-grades = L.map(lam(score):
  if score >= 90: "A"
  else if score >= 80: "B"
  else if score >= 70: "C"
  else if score >= 60: "D"
  else: "F"
  end
end, curved-scores)
```

**Check Understanding:** Ask, "How many students got each letter grade?"

### B. Filtering and Distinct Operations
Introduce additional list operations (`filter` and `distinct`):

```pyret
# Find unique letter grades assigned
unique-grades = L.distinct(letter-grades)

# Filter to find only passing scores
passing-scores = L.filter(lam(score): score >= 60 end, curved-scores)

# Count how many students passed
num-passing = passing-scores.length()
```

## VI. Recap and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

### Key Points Discussion:
- **Lists vs Tables:** Lists are single-column, ordered collections
- **Mathematical Operations:** Built-in functions for statistical analysis
- **Map Transformations:** Apply functions to every element
- **Filter Operations:** Remove elements that don't meet criteria
- **Distinct Operations:** Remove duplicates to find unique values in a list 

### Reflection Questions:
- "When would you use a list instead of a table?"
- "What real-world data could you analyze using these list operations?"
