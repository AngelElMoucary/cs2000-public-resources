## Reading: [4.1]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/intro-tabular-data.html)

### Define a Table Constant
Have students define a table containing information about several national parks:

```pyret
PARKS = table: name, state, established, area-sq-miles, visitors-2024
  row: "Yellowstone", "Wyoming", 1872, 3472, 4500000
  row: "Yosemite", "California", 1890, 1168, 3900000  
  row: "Grand Canyon", "Arizona", 1919, 1904, 6400000
  row: "Zion", "Utah", 1919, 229, 4700000
  row: "Rocky Mountain", "Colorado", 1915, 415, 4300000
  row: "Acadia", "Maine", 1916, 198, 2500000
  row: "Great Smoky Mountains", "Tennessee", 1934, 816, 12100000
  row: "Bryce Canyon", "Utah", 1928, 56, 2900000
end
```

### Understanding Table Structure
 Point out that tables have:
- **Columns** (name, state, established, area-sq-miles, visitors-2024)
- **Rows** (each park is one row)
- **Headers** that describe what each column contains

### Accessing Individual Values
*g*Activity:** Show students vhow to extract specific data using row and column access:

```pyret
# Get the name of the first park
PARKS.row-n(0)["name"]

# Get the number of visitors to Yosemite (row 1)
PARKS.row-n(1)["visitors-2024"]
```

### Answering Questions with Data
**Question 1:** "Which park was established first?"
- Students should examine the 'established' column.

**Question 2:** "What's the total area of parks in Utah?"
- Students need to identify Utah parks and add their areas.

## Filtering Tables

**Explanation:** Introduce the `filter-with` operation to find rows that meet certain criteria.

Have students write filters to answer specific questions:

- Parks established before 1920.
- Parks with more than 4 million visitors.

## Ordering and Sorting Tables

```pyret
# Sort parks by area (smallest to largest)
parks-by-area = order-by(PARKS, "area-sq-miles", true)
```

As an exercise, now sort by number of visitors.

**Check Understanding:** 
"What does the `true` parameter mean in order-by?"

## Wrap-Up
- "Which operation was most useful for answering questions about the data?"
- "What happens if you filter a table and get zero results?"
