title: Day 3 - Definitions
---

### This is pre-design recipe -- no functions, so no signatures, purpose, tests.

## Outcomes: None
 

## Organizing Code with Names, Definitions, and the Program Directory

### **Day Objectives**
- Understand the purpose of the definitions pane versus the interactions pane.
- Learn how to create and use names (identifiers) to refer to values.
- Distinguish between expressions and definitions (statements).
- Understand the role of a program directory.
- See how naming can simplify the construction of more complex images and programs.

### **I. Introduction (5 minutes)**

- **Overview:**
  Explain that in our programming environment we have two panes: one for interactive commands (like a calculator) and another for storing code definitions. Today, we'll focus on the definitions.

---

### **II. The Two Panes: Interactions vs. Definitions (10 minutes)**
- **Definitions Pane:**
  - Explain that this pane is like your "notebook" for saving code.
  - Emphasize that code here persists and is used to "remember" expressions, code, etc, similar to writing formulas in a notebook.

- **Interactions Pane:**
  - Explain that this is like a calculator: you type an expression and immediately see the result.
  - The interactions also shows feedback from running the program that exists in the definitions pane.

- **Live Demo (with different examples):**
  - **Example:** In the definitions pane, type:
    ```pyret
    blue-square = rectangle(40, 40, "solid", "blue")
    ```
    Then press "Run". Initially, nothing seems to happen, but now if we type `blue-square` in the interactions, we see a blue square image.
  - **Discussion:**
    Explain that running caused everything in the definitions pane to evaluate, resulting in the expression for the blue square to be stored under the name `blue-square` so we can refer to it later.

---

### **III. Naming Values and Using Identifiers (15 minutes)**
- **Why Name Things?**
  - Explain that long expressions (like drawing a detailed graphic) can be tedious to write repeatedly.
  - Naming values lets us reuse complex expressions without retyping.

- **Syntax for Naming:**
  - **Rule:** Write a name, then an equals sign (`=`), followed by an expression.
  - **Example:**
    ```pyret
    green-circle = circle(25, "solid", "green")
    ```
    Run it, then type `green-circle` in the interactions pane.

- **Names vs. Strings:**
  - **Clarify the Difference:**
    - **Names/Identifiers:** Written without quotes (e.g., `green-circle`), used to refer to saved values.
    - **Strings:** Written with double quotes (e.g., `"green-circle"`), treated as data.
  - **Interactive Exercise:**
    Ask the students:
    - What do you think will happen if you type `puppy` versus `"puppy"` at the prompt?
    - Run both examples to see that `puppy` (if not defined) gives an error (an "unbound" error) while `"puppy"` simply returns the string.

- **Hands-On Exercise (Do Now):**
  - Ask students to try defining an orange triangle with side length 35, i.e., something like:
    ```pyret
    orange-triangle = triangle(35, "solid", "orange")
    ```
    and then evaluate their identifier (i.e., `orange-triangle`) in the interactions pane.
  - **Discuss:** What did you see? How does naming help?

---

### **IV. Expressions vs. Definitions (10 minutes)**
- **Definitions (Statements):**
  - Explain that when you write a definition, you instruct the program to store a value but nothing is "printed" or returned immediately.
  - **Example:**
    ```pyret
    x = 10 + 15
    ```
    Notice that nothing is displayed; the value is stored in what we'll refer to as the "program directory".

- **Expressions:**
  - Explain that expressions are computations that return a value immediately.
  - **Example:**
    ```pyret
    10 + 15
    ```
    This displays the result (25) in the interactions pane.

- **Interactive Comparison:**
  - Have students type:
    ```pyret
    7 * 3
    ```
    versus
    ```pyret
    y = 7 * 3
    ```
    Then ask:
    - What is the difference in what is shown?
    - What happens when you then type `y`?

- **Key Takeaway:**
  - Using a name (like `y`) is an expression because it retrieves the stored value.

---

### **V. The Program Directory (10 minutes)**
- **What Is It?**
  - We can understand how our programs work, and how definitions work, with the notion that the programming environment has a directory that it uses to keep track of names and their values.

- **How It Works:**
  - When you define a name (e.g., `radius = 20`), the program directory records that `radius` maps to `20`.
  - When you then write:
    ```pyret
    area = 3.14 * radius * radius
    ```
    The environment looks up `radius` in the directory, uses the value stored there to compute the area, and stores the resulting value in the directory with the name `area`.
    Now the directory has **two** entries in it: `radius` and `area`.

- **Demonstration with a New Example:**
  - In the definitions pane, type:
    ```pyret
    side-length = 50
    square-area = side-length * side-length
    blue-square = rectangle(side-length, side-length, "solid", "blue")
    ```
  - Press "Run" and then type `blue-square` in the interactions pane.
  - **Discussion:**
    Ask, "Can you see the intermediate names `side-length` and `square-area`? Are they visible in the image? Why or why not?"
    (Answer: Only `blue-square` is used to display the image because it is the name of the image; the other names are stored in the directory for computations.
    Important: the directory maps names to **values** -- names are not themselves values, so they will never show up in what is stored in the directory.)

- **Shadowing and Reassignment:**
  - Explain that if you try to define a name that already exists, the system prevents you, telling you it "shadows a previous declaration."
  - **Interactive Exercise:**
    Have students try:
    ```pyret
    side-length = 40
    ```
    and see the error. Then ask them to evaluate `side-length` and explain why the value didn't change.

---

### **VI. Using Names to Streamline Building Images (10 minutes)**
- **Building Complex Images:**
  - Introduce the idea that naming can help simplify complex expressions, for example when composing images.

- **Step-by-Step Example:**
  - **Without Naming:**
    ```pyret
    overlay(scale(1.5, circle(20, "solid", "yellow")),
            rectangle(80, 80, "solid", "black"))
    ```
    Explain that this single line might be hard to read.

  - **With Naming:**
    ```pyret
    small-circle = circle(20, "solid", "yellow")
    big-rect = rectangle(80, 80, "solid", "black")
    scaled-circle = scale(1.5, small-circle)

    final-image = overlay(scaled-circle, big-rect)
    ```
    Run these definitions and then type `final-image` in the interactions pane.

  - **Discussion:**
    Ask: "Are there other things we might want to make definitions for?" Answer: `circle-radius`, `rect-side-len`

- **Reusing Names:**
  - Emphasize that when a name is used in more than one place, you only need to write its definition once.
  - **Exercise:**
    Ask students to modify the above example to overlay two copies of `small-circle` on top of `big-rect` (one scaled and one not), using names for clarity.

---

### **VII. Wrap-Up and Q&A (5 minutes)**
- **Summary of Key Points:**
  - The definitions pane lets you store and organize code for later use.
  - Names (identifiers) let you refer to complex expressions easily.
  - There's a clear difference between expressions (which compute values) and definitions (which store values without directly displaying them).
  - An internal directory tracks all our names and their associated values.
  - Using names makes building and understanding complex images (or programs) much easier.

- **Questions for the Class:**
  - "How might using names benefit you when you write a longer program?"
  - "What are some pitfalls when naming things (e.g., accidentally using a string when you meant a name)?"

- **Final Exercise for Reflection:**
  - Ask students to think of a simple flag or logo design. Have them sketch out a plan on paper and write a plan that uses names to define each part of the design. They can share their ideas with a partner.

- **Closing:**
  Encourage students to experiment in the definitions pane. Remind them that the more they practice naming and organizing their code, the more intuitive it becomes.
