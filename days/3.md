## Announcements

- Talk about HW submission -- first HW is due on Thursday night.
- Make sure people are on Discord.

## Intro (15 mins)

- Review "definitions" window for permanent work, "interactions" window for testing it, trying things out, etc.
- While we've been using the definitions window to write down expressions, and see them printed out when we hit Run, the primary use is actually to write *named* definitions, like:
  ```pyret
  blue-square = rectangle(40, 40, "solid", "blue")
  ```
- When we hit Run, initially, nothing seems to happen, but now if we type `blue-square` in the interactions, we see a blue square image.
- Running caused everything in the definitions pane to evaluate, including the `rectangle` expression above, which evaluated to a blue square. The definition statement `blue-square = ...` caused the resulting value to be stored under that name so we can refer to it later.
- IMPORTANT: names & strings are different! `"blue-square"` is not the same as `blue-square`.
  - What do you think will happen if you type `puppy` versus `"puppy"` at the prompt?
- We can understand how our programs work, and how definitions work, by understanding how the **program directory** works.
- Every definition statement, written `name = expression` causes `expression` to be evaluated and `name` to be added to the **program directory**, so it can be used later, including in other expressions for other definitions.
- e.g., you can write `radius = 10` and then `area = 3.14 * radius * radius`. If you do those in the other order (TRY IT), it won't work, since the directory won't have the `radius` entry yet -- since the definitions are added in order, the order we define things matters.

## Class Exercise (40 mins)

- **Define** an an orange triangle with side length 35. Now evaluate the name (or identifier, or variable -- all of these are synonyms that programmers use for the same thing) (i.e., `orange-triangle`) in the interactions pane.

- Define a side length and color (as two separate definitions), and then define a square using those names for the side length and color.

- Now define a second version where you do not use the side length and color
  variables (or name, or identifier). Notice that when you evaluate both identifiers in the interactions,
  they are exactly the same, but the code is easier to read with the separate
  definitions.

- Try defining a new side length with the _same name_, later in the
  definitions. Note what happens when you try to hit "Run". Redefining the same
  variable is called "shadowing", and Pyret rules this out, since it is a common
  cause of bugs.

- Now define an image that has a small yellow circle on top of a larger black
  rectangle. Try several different ways, using different number of definitions.
  See which is easiest to understand.

- Go back to your previous examples and see if there are other definitions you
  can add. Did you make definitions for the radius of circles you made? The
  length of your orange triangle? Try changing the code to include all of those.

- If you make a definition for the color of your orange triangle, what did you
  name it? If you want to change the color of the triangle, will you have to
  change the name of the definition (i.e., if you used `orange`, but wanted to
  make the triangle purple, you should probably change it to `purple = "purple"`)? If so, that's an indication that perhaps the definition was not
  helpful, or didn't have a good name. Having to change the definition name
  means you will also have to change the uses of the definition!

- Now make a new image that puts two copies of your small yellow circle
  side-by-side on top of your black rectangle.

- Now think of a simple flag or logo design. Sketch out a plan on paper and come up with names for different parts of the design. If you have time, make definitions for each part, and compose them together to make the final image.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)

- Definitions involve the first aspect of program *design*. **Notice how there
  were often many different ways of writing the same program**, some of which were
  easier to understand, easier to modify, and even possibly easier to write.
- One of the main lessons of this class, and indeed this whole curriculum, is
  that **well designed code is something much more important, and often more
  challenging, than just getting code to work**. Of course code has to work, but
  for it to work in real systems, at the scale that we are building them, messy,
  convoluted, or confusing code can make it so hard for people to understand
  what is going on that even getting it to work, as the programs get bigger,
  becomes impossible.
- By focusing on design, from the very beginning, you'll develop skills that will
  help you all the way through, as programs get bigger and bigger!
