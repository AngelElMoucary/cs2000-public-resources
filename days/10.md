## Intro (15 mins)

- In the last few classes, we've shown table operations that take functions as
  arguments; some of those are complex, and benefit from being written with our
  full design process (e.g., `calc-distance`, or the function to obfuscate item
  names), but others, like `subtract-1` seem a bit unnecessary. It would be nice
  if we could write:
  ```pyret
  t = table: x-coord :: Number, y-coord :: Number
    row: 1, 2
    row: 3, 4
  end
  transform-column(t, "x-coord", n - 1)
  ```
- But if we try to run this, we get an error -- `n` is not defined. What we
  want, instead of `n`, is a way of referring to the column value that is being
  transformed. When we defined a function, this is the argument:
  ```pyret
  fun subtract-1(n :: Number) -> Number:
    doc: "subtracts 1 from input"
    n - 1
  where:
    subtract-1(10) is 9
    subtract-1(0) is -1
    subtract-1(-3.5) is -4.5
  end
  ```
- For simple functions, we can do this with `lam`, which creates an unnamed function:
  ```pyret
  transform-column(t, "x-coord", lam(n :: Number): n - 1 end)
  ```
- Another oddity about the last few classes is that while we've followed our
  design process for _helper_ functions, we haven't actually written functions
  that take tables and produce tables, and (for the most part), haven't written
  tests on tables.
- For example, let's design a function that transforms a table, modifying a
  `"price"` column by discounting it by 20%, but only for prices that are below
  100\.
  ```pyret
  fun apply-discounts(t :: Table) -> Table:
    doc: "transforms 'price' column by reducing 20%, if value is below 100"
    transform-column(t, "price", lam(price :: Number): 
      if price < 100: price * 0.8 else: price end
    end)
  where:
    test-table =
      table: price
        row: 50
        row: 120
        row: 80
        row: 40
      end
    apply-discounts(test-table) is
    table: price
      row: 50 * 0.8
      row: 120
      row: 80 * 0.8
      row: 40 * 0.8
    end
  end
  ```
- Note how we created an example table within our `where:` block, and in the
  test, rather than computing the actual numbers, wrote the expressions for the
  rows that should have changed. This makes it easier to understand the behavior.

## Class Exercise (40 mins)

- Design a function that takes a table that has a "price" column and adds a new
  column "tax", which is the sales tax rate where you are multiplied by the
  price. You can assume there is not already a tax column.
- Create a function to carry out the "obfuscation" exercise from last class, and
  write tests for it. Note, your test tables should only need an `"item"` column!
- Create a function to carry out the employee total earnings calculation from
  last time, and again write tests.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)

- `lam` allows us to more concisely use operations that expect functions as
  inputs, like `transform-column`, `build-column`, `filter-with`, `order-by`,
  etc.
- Table functions should follow the same design process, and include tests, just
  like other functions!
