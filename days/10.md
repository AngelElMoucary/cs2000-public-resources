ALSO: expand option type explanation (what is there is woefully inadequate)

## Cleaning Data Tables and Handling Missing Entries

**Topic Focus:** How to load data, handle missing entries, and normalize values in a table.

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Overview:**  
  - Introduce the challenges of real‑world data: missing entries, inconsistent formats, and typos.
  - Explain that cleaning data is often the first step in analysis.
- **Do Now:**  
  - Show a simplified screenshot (or describe) a table of customer orders with issues:
    - Columns: `order-id`, `email`, `quantity`, `coupon`
    - Problems: Some `quantity` values are strings, some `coupon` cells are blank or contain inconsistent text like `"none"`, `"None"`, or `" n/a "`.
- **Discussion Prompt:**  
  - “What kinds of problems do you foresee when using such data for analysis?”

### 2. Loading and Sanitizing Data (20 minutes)
- **Simulated Data Loading:**  
  - Present a self-contained table that represents loaded data:
  ```pyret
  raw-orders =
    table: order-id, email, quantity, coupon
      row: 101, "alice@example.com", "5", "SAVE10"
      row: 102, "bob@example.com", "three", ""
      row: 103, "carol@example.com", "7", "None"
      row: 104, "dan@example.com", 8, " n/a "
    end
  ```
- **Problem Discussion:**  
  - Explain that `"5"` and `"7"` are strings, `"three"` is non-numeric, and coupon codes are inconsistent.
- **Sanitizing Approach:**  
  - Demonstrate using column transformers to:
    - Convert `quantity` to numbers (or default to 0 if conversion fails).
    - Normalize the `coupon` column: treat blank strings and various forms of “none” as a standard value.
- **Normalization Function Example:**  
  - Write a function to normalize coupon codes:
  ```pyret
  fun normalize-coupon(code :: String) -> String:
    if string-to-lower(code) == "" or string-to-lower(code) == "none" or string-to-lower(code) == " n/a ":
      "NO COUPON"
    else:
      string-trim(code)
    end
  end
  where:
    normalize-coupon("") is "NO COUPON"
    normalize-coupon("None") is "NO COUPON"
    normalize-coupon(" n/a ") is "NO COUPON"
    normalize-coupon("SAVE10") is "SAVE10"
  end
  ```
- **Applying the Sanitization:**  
  - Show how to transform the table:
  ```pyret
  clean-orders =
    transform-column(raw-orders, "coupon", normalize-coupon)
  ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**  
  - Ask students to design a helper function to clean the `quantity` column.  
    (For example, converting numeric strings to numbers and treating non-numeric entries as 0.)
- **Discussion:**  
  - Discuss why it is important to sanitize data before further analysis.

### 3. Handling Missing or Inconsistent Data (15 minutes)
- **Option Types in Pyret:**  
  - Explain the concept of `none` and `some` for optional data.
  TODO: EXPAND THIS
- **Additional Example:**  
  - Show a mini–example of how missing values might appear and how to convert them to a default.
  ```pyret
  // Example: In a table of customer feedback, missing comments become empty strings.
  raw-feedback =
    table: customer, comment
      row: "Alice", "Great service"
      row: "Bob", none
      row: "Carol", "   "
    end
  ```
- **Cleaning Feedback Comments:**  
  - Write a function that converts any comment that is `none` or only spaces to `"No comment"`:
  ```pyret
  fun clean-comment(c :: Option<String>) -> String:
    trimmed = c.and-then(string-trim) 
    if (trimmed == some("")) or (trimmed == none):
      "No comment"
    else:
      trimmed.v
    end
  end
  ```
- **Exercise:**  
  - Have students discuss and suggest how this approach could be applied to other columns.

### 4. Wrap-Up (5 minutes)
- **Recap:**  
  - Summarize strategies for loading, sanitizing, and normalizing data.
