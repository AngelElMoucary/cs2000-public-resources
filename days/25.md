## Skills: None

## Pre-reading: [9.1.6](<%7B%7BDCIC_DOMAIN%7D%7D/intro-python.html#(part._python-create-process-lists)>), [9.1.7](<%7B%7BDCIC_DOMAIN%7D%7D/intro-python.html#(part._python-data-with-components)>)

## Intro (15 mins)

- Today we explore how to create and process lists in Python, and compare with Pyret.
- In Python, lists are created with square brackets, e.g.:
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
  ```
- Python has built-in functions like `filter` and `map` for processing lists (just like you learned in Pyret, in [Day 14](/days/14)), but you must wrap their results with `list()`:
  ```python
  fruits_with_a = list(filter(lambda f: "a" in f, fruits))
  # ["apple", "banana", "date"]
  fruits_upper = list(map(lambda f: f.upper(), fruits))
  # ["APPLE", "BANANA", "CHERRY", "DATE"]
  ```
- Anonymous functions use `lambda` in Python -- but these are more restricted than Pyret's `lam`, as the body can be a single expression only (i.e., you cannot have an `if`, `for`, variable assignment, etc, inside a `lambda`).
- **Dataclasses:** Python's `@dataclass` decorator, combined with the `class` feature, allows you to define structured data types, similar to structured data using a single variant with Pyret's `data` definitions (**conditional data is more complicated, and not covered here**). Example:
  ```python
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  @dataclass
  class Fruit:
      name: str
      color: str
  ```

## Class Exercises (40 mins)

- Create a list of integers from 1 to 10.
- Write a expression using `map` that produces a list of their squares.
- Design a function `all_even(nums: list) -> list` that returns a list of all even numbers from the input list.
- Design a function `capitalize_all(words: list) -> list` that returns a list of all words capitalized.
- Use `map` and `lambda` to produce a list of the lengths of each word in `["hello", "world", "python"]`.
- What happens if you forget to wrap the result in `list()`? Try it and note the error.
- Define a `@dataclass` called `Book` with fields `title` (str), `author` (str), and `pages` (int).
- Design a function `long_books(books: list) -> list` that returns a list of titles of books with more than 300 pages. Remember to always include docstring, type signature, and pytest tests.
- Create a list of `Book` instances and use `long_books` to filter them.
- Design a function `filter_by_author(books: list, author: str) -> list` that returns a list of titles of books by the given author.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)

- Python lists use square brackets and require wrapping `map`/`filter` results with `list()`.
- Dataclasses provide a way to define structured data, similar to a single variant of Pyret's `data`.
