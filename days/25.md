## Creating and Processing Lists in Python

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Overview:**
  - Recap that in Pyret we have used both recursion and for‑each loops to process lists.
  - Today we show how Python’s handles lists.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Learn how to create lists in Python.
  - Explore built‑in list functions such as filter, map, and length.
  - Contrast Python’s style with Pyret’s `for each` loops and recursive definitions.

### 2. Creating and Processing Lists
- **Creating Lists:**
  - **Python Example:**
    ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
    ```
- **Using Filter and Map:**
  - **Example 1:** Filtering words containing the letter “a”
    ```python
    fruits_with_a = list(filter(lambda f: "a" in f, fruits))
    # Expected: ["apple", "banana", "date"]
    ```
  - **Example 2:** Mapping to uppercase
    ```python
    fruits_upper = list(map(lambda f: f.upper(), fruits))
    # Expected: ["APPLE", "BANANA", "CHERRY", "DATE"]
    ```
    
  - NOTE: `map` and `filter` in Python don't return lists directly, but the
    return type (a more complicated abstraction called an iterator) can be
    converted to a list with the function `list`, as we've done above.
    
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask students: “Write an expression that produces a list of the lengths of each fruit name.”
  - Expected answer:
    ```python
    fruit_lengths = list(map(len, fruits))
    # Expected: [5, 6, 6, 4]
    ```
- **Comparison with Pyret:**
  - Briefly review that in Pyret, lists are created with `[list: ...]` and functions like filter and map directly return lists.
  
### 3. Test Cases for List Functions in Python
- **Example Function – `all_long_words`:**
  - **Task:** Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a list of words with more than 5 letters.
  - **Python Code:**
    ```python
    def all_long_words(word_list: list) -> list:
        return list(filter(lambda wd: len(wd) > 5, word_list))
    ```
  - NOTE: `lambda` used for anonymous functions, instead of `lam`, but no parenthesis. Also `lambda` in python can only be a single expression, unlike
    Pyret.
- **Test Cases Using pytest:**
    ```python
    def test_all_long_words():
        words = ["sky", "ocean", "mountain", "river"]
        assert all_long_words(words) == ["ocean", "mountain"]
    ```
- **Do Now:**
  - Ask: “What happens if you forget to wrap filter with list()? (Discuss error messages like ‘object of type 'filter' has no len()’.)”

### 4. Wrap-Up (10 minutes)
- **Recap Key Points:**
  - How lists are defined in Python versus Pyret.
  - Using filter and map in Python requires wrapping the result in list.
  - Notational differences: square brackets vs. `[list: …]`, lambda usage, etc.
- **Exit Ticket:**
  - Students write a brief explanation (2–3 sentences) comparing Python’s list processing functions to Pyret’s methods.
- **Preview Next Lecture:**
  - “Next, we’ll explore how to traverse lists using Python’s for loops—and we’ll contrast that with Pyret’s recursive and for‑each loop approaches.”
