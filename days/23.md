title: Day 23 - Trees as recursive data
---

NOTE: should not start with an n-ary tree. Should start with simple binary tree.
Maybe back in L22, would resolve that issue as well.

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Overview:**
  - Recap the limitations of tables for tree data.
  - Return to the idea of recursive data: data defined in terms of themselves (like lists!)
- **Our New Example: Organization Tree**
  - We will represent an organization’s hierarchy as a tree.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Define a recursive datatype for the organization.
  - See how the structure (node plus subtrees) suggests a recursive approach.
- **Do Now:**
  - Ask: “What parts does an organizational node have? (e.g., name, title, subordinates)”
  - Brief discussion.

### 2. Defining a Recursive Datatype for Organization Trees (20 minutes)
- **Data Definition:**
  - Present a new datatype called `OrgTree`:
    ```pyret
    data OrgTree:
      | node(name :: String, title :: String, reports :: List<OrgTree>)
    end
    ```
  - Explain that each node has a name, title, and a list of subordinate nodes.
- **Creating Examples:**
  - Build a simple organization tree:
    ```pyret
    # Example: A small organization
    dave-tree = node("Dave", "Engineer", empty)
    frank-tree = node("Frank", "Engineer", empty)
    bob-tree = node("Bob", "CTO", [list: dave-tree, frank-tree])
    eve-tree = node("Eve", "Accountant", empty)
    carol-tree = node("Carol", "CFO", [list: eve-tree])
    alice-tree = node("Alice", "CEO", [list: bob-tree, carol-tree])
    ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Compare this recursive representation to the flat table.
  - Ask: “How does this datatype make it easier to answer questions like ‘How many employees are under Bob?’ or ‘What is the organizational depth?’”

### 3. Discovering Recursive Functions on Trees (20 minutes)
- **Observation:**
  - Notice that an `OrgTree` node consists of a value (name and title) and a list of subtrees.
  - The recursive nature of lists (as we saw earlier) applies here too.
- **Example Function – Counting Nodes (`org-size`):**
  - **Walk Through Examples:**
    - For a tree with no reports, size is 1.
    - For a tree with reports, size is 1 (for the current node) plus the sizes of each subtree.
  - **Code via Recursion:**
    ```pyret
    fun org-size(t :: OrgTree) -> Number:
      cases (OrgTree) t:
        | node(n, title, reports) =>
          1 + org-size-list(reports)
      end
    end

    # Helper function: recursively compute the size of a list of OrgTree nodes
    fun org-size-list(ts :: List<OrgTree>) -> Number:
      cases (List) ts:
        | empty => 0
        | link(first, rest) => org-size(first) + org-size-list(rest)
      end
    end
    ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask students: “Trace `org-size(alice-tree)`. What is the total number of nodes (employees)?”
- **Discussion:**
  - Emphasize how the recursive structure of the datatype guided the function design.
  - Ask: “What similarities do you see between processing lists recursively and processing trees?”

### 4. Wrap-Up and Reflection (10 minutes)
- **Summary:**
  - Reinforce that recursive data types (like `OrgTree`) naturally capture hierarchical relationships.
  - The same recursive template used for lists (handling base cases and recursive cases) can be extended to trees.
- **Exit Ticket:**
  - Each student writes one sentence explaining why a recursive representation is better for hierarchical data than a table.
- **Preview Next Lecture:**
  - “Next, we’ll delve deeper into tree traversal and transformation, and discuss why simple linear iteration (like for each loops) does not work on trees.”
