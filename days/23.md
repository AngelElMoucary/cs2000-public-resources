## Pre-reading: [7.1.3](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/trees.html#(part._.Summarizing_.How_to_.Approach_.Tree_.Problems)), [7.1.4](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/trees.html#(part._.Study_.Questions))

## Intro (10 mins)
- Trees are recursive, branching data structures.
- Many tree operations involve traversing or transforming the tree recursively.
- Example: Flattening a tree into a list of names (pre-order traversal):
  ```pyret
  fun flatten-org(t :: OrgTree) -> List<String>:
    cases (OrgTree) t:
      | node(n, title, reports) =>
        [list: n] + flatten-org-list(reports)
    end
  end

  fun flatten-org-list(ts :: List<OrgTree>) -> List<String>:
    cases (List) ts:
      | empty => empty
      | link(first, rest) => flatten-org(first) + flatten-org-list(rest)
    end
  end
  ```

## Class Exercises (40 mins)
Given the `OrgTree` data definition and example trees from last class:

1. **Post-Order Traversal:** Write a function `flatten-org-post` that returns a list of names in post-order (visit all reports before the current node).
2. **Transform Titles:** Write a function `title-suffix` that takes an `OrgTree` and a string, and returns a new tree where every title has the suffix added (e.g., " (Manager)").
3. **Count Leaves:** Write a function `count-leaves` that returns the number of employees with no reports.
4. **Replace Name:** Write a function `replace-name` that takes an `OrgTree`, an old name, and a new name, and returns a new tree with the name replaced everywhere it occurs.
5. **Find All Paths:** Write a function `all-paths` that returns a list of lists, where each inner list is the path from the root to a leaf.
6. **Level-Order Traversal (Challenge):** Write a function `flatten-org-level` that returns a list of names in level-order (breadth-first).

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Recursive tree functions let us traverse and transform hierarchical data in many ways.
- Next time: more advanced tree processing and applications.
