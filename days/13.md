## Operating on Lists and Transforming Data

**Focus:** Work with built‑in operations on lists—computing statistics on numeric lists and using functions like filter, map, distinct, and getting elements by position.

### 1. Warm-Up & Recap (10 minutes)
- **Recap:**
  - Quick review of what lists are from the previous lecture.
- **Do Now:**
  - “Imagine you have a list of recipe ratings (numbers). What might you want to know? (e.g., highest rating, average rating)”
  - Share ideas with the class.

### 2. Built‑In Operations on Numeric Lists (15 minutes)
- **New Example:**
  Consider a table for recipe reviews:
  ```pyret
  reviews =
    table: recipe, rating
      row: "Pasta", 4.5
      row: "Salad", 3.8
      row: "Soup", 4.2
      row: "Sandwich", 5.0
      row: "Cake", 4.9
    end
  ```
- **Extracting the Numeric Column:**
  ```pyret
  ratings = reviews.get-column("rating")
  ```
- **Computations:**
  - Use math/statistics libraries:
    ```pyret
    import math as M
    import statistics as S

    M.max(ratings)      // highest rating
    S.mean(ratings)     // average rating
    M.sum(ratings)      // total of ratings
    ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask: “What is the median rating?”
  - Have students compute using `S.median(ratings)`.
- **Discussion:**
  - How could these statistics inform decisions (e.g., which recipe is most popular)?

### 3. Built‑In Operations on Lists of Strings (15 minutes)
- **Discount Codes in a Food Delivery App:**
  Imagine a list of discount codes used:
  ```pyret
  discount-codes = [list: "NEWYEAR", "student", "NONE", "student", "VIP", "none"]
  ```
- **Finding Unique Values:**
  - Use the lists library:
    ```pyret
    import lists as L

    unique-codes = L.distinct(discount-codes)
    ```
  - Show the result (e.g., `[list: "NEWYEAR", "student", "NONE", "VIP", "none"]`).
- **Filtering:**
  - Remove codes that represent no discount (in this case, normalized "none").
  - Define a helper function:
    ```pyret
    fun is-real-code(code :: String) -> Boolean:
      not(string-to-lower(code) == "none")
    end

    real-codes = L.filter(is-real-code, unique-codes)
    ```
  - **Do Now:**
    - Ask: “What is the length of the resulting list?” (Hint: Use `L.length(real-codes)`.)
- **Getting Elements by Position:**
  - Like how tables have `row-n()`, lists have a way of getting an element by position:
    ```pyret
    first-code = real-codes.get(0)
    ```
  - **Discussion:**
    - Explain zero-based indexing and why `get(0)` returns the first element.
- **Transforming Lists with Map:**
  - Extract the lowercase versions of each discount code:
    ```pyret
    lower-codes = L.map(lam(code): string-to-lower(code) end, codes-real)
    ```
  - Ask students to predict the output.
  - `L.map` is similar to how `transform-column` worked to update a column in a
    table, but since a list is just a single sequence of values, it updates the whole thing.

### 4. Wrap-Up & Reflection (10 minutes)
- **Recap Key Operations:**
  - Filter, distinct, length, get, and map.
- **Interactive Question:**
  - “How would you remove all ingredients that are completely lowercase from a list of ingredients?”
  - (Set up for next lecture’s custom list functions.)
