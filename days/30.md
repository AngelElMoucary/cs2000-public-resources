## Skills: None

## Pre-reading: [10.1.4]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#(part._.Computing_.New_.Columns)), [10.1.5]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#(part._.Aggregating_and_.Grouping_.Columns))

## Reference: For all work with tables, refer to the [Tables](/tables) page in the menu at the top of the page! It covers Pyret tables, but is good reference regardless.


## Intro (10 mins)
Today we learn Pandas operations that correspond to what you learned in Pyret: filtering tables, sorting, and adding/transforming columns.

**Filtering rows** (like Pyret's `filter-with`):
```python
# Pyret way:
# fun is-high-value(r :: Row) -> Boolean:
#   r["amount"] >= 5.0
# end
# high-orders = filter-with(orders, is-high-value)

# Pandas way -- we construct "masks" that look like boolean expressions, but 
# refers to an entire column (i.e., Series).
high_orders = orders[orders['quantity'] >= 2]
takeout_orders = orders[orders['order_type'] == 'takeout']
```

**Sorting tables** (like Pyret's `order-by`):
```python
# Pyret way:
# order-by(orders, "quantity", true)   # ascending
# order-by(orders, "quantity", false)  # descending

# Pandas way:
orders.sort_values('quantity')                    # ascending
orders.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)   # descending
```

**Adding new columns** (like Pyret's `build-column`):
```python
# Pyret way:
# fun calc-total(r :: Row) -> Number:
#   r["quantity"] * prices[r["dish"]]
# end
# orders-with-total = build-column(orders, "total", calc-total)

# Pandas way -- we _assign_ to a new column (here 'total') and construct it 
# by applying a function (here a `lambda`) that is passed a row.
prices = {'Pasta': 12.0, 'Salad': 8.0, 'Burger': 10.0}
orders['total'] = orders.apply(lambda row: row['quantity'] * prices.get(row['dish'], 0), axis=1)
```

**Transforming existing columns** (like Pyret's `transform-column`):
```python
# Pyret way:
# fun discount-price(price :: Number) -> Number:
#   price * 0.9
# end
# discounted = transform-column(orders, "total", discount-price)

# Pandas way -- here, we similarly assign to a column, but this time 
# an existing one. But to create it, we again use `.apply` with a function, 
# but here on a single column (Series), so the function is over the single 
# values, rather than the entire row. We could transform an existing column using the
# entire row (something not possible with Pyret) by using 
# `orders.apply(lambda row: ...)` as above.
orders['total'] = orders['total'].apply(lambda price: price * 0.9)
```

## Class Exercises (35 mins)
**Filtering:**
- Filter your workout DataFrame to show only workouts longer than 45 minutes.
- From the photos dataset, filter to show only photos with subject "Forest".
- What happens if you try to filter by a column that doesn't exist? Try it and note the error.

**Sorting:**
- Sort your workout DataFrame by duration from longest to shortest.
- Sort the photos dataset by date (ascending), then print the first 5 rows.

**Adding new columns (like `build-column`):**
- Add a column called `workout_category` that is "long" if duration â‰¥ 60, "medium" if 30-59, "short" otherwise.
- For your workouts, add a column called `calories_burned` that estimates calories as duration * 8.
- In the photos dataset, add a column called `is_landscape` that checks if the location contains "Park" or "Garden".

**Transforming columns (like `transform-column`):**
- Convert all workout durations from minutes to hours (divide by 60).
- In the photos dataset, transform the subject column to be all uppercase.

**Combining operations:**
- Filter workouts to only "long" category, then sort by calories burned.
- What is the average duration of workouts in each category?

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Pandas provides the same table operations you learned in Pyret: filtering with boolean conditions, sorting by columns, adding new columns with computations, and transforming existing columns.
- The syntax is different (boolean masks vs functions, `.sort_values()` vs `order-by`), but the concepts and capabilities are the same.
