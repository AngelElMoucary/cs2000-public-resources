title: Day 30 - Computing columns with Pandas

## Skills: None

## Pre-reading: [10.1.4]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#(part._.Computing_.New_.Columns)) (PROBABLY EXPAND), [10.1.5]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#(part._.Aggregating_and_.Grouping_.Columns))

## Intro (10 mins)
- Today we extend our work with Pandas DataFrames by computing new columns and aggregating data to answer questions.
- You can create new columns using arithmetic and `apply` with `lambda`:
  ```python
  # Assume orders DataFrame and prices dictionary already defined
  prices = {'Pasta': 12.0, 'Salad': 8.0, 'Burger': 10.0, 'Steak': 19.0}
  orders['total_price'] = orders.apply(lambda row: row['quantity'] * prices.get(row['dish'], 0), axis=1)
  print(orders[['dish', 'quantity', 'total_price']])
  ```
  Note what happened -- we wrote `orders['total_price'] =` and assigned a new _column_. This is analogous to using `build-column` with Pyret, though could also be used to transform columns, if they already existed.
- You can update columns conditionally using boolean masks and `.loc`:
  ```python
  discount_mask = orders['order_type'] == 'takeout'
  orders.loc[discount_mask, 'total_price'] = orders.loc[discount_mask, 'total_price'] * 0.90
  ```
  This is essentially a combination of filtering, updating, and transforming.
- Aggregation and grouping let you summarize data:
  ```python
  total_quantity = orders['quantity'].sum()
  sales_per_dish = orders.groupby('dish')['total_price'].sum()
  avg_quantity_by_type = orders.groupby('order_type')['quantity'].mean()
  ```
- These tools let you answer questions like "What is the total sales per dish?" or "What is the average quantity per order type?"

## Class Exercises (35 mins)
- Add a new column to your DataFrame called `is_large_order` that is `True` if quantity ≥ 3, otherwise `False`.
- Create a new column called `discounted_price` that applies a 10% discount to takeout orders, and is equal to `total_price` otherwise.
- Compute the total revenue (sum of `discounted_price`) for all orders.
- Group the DataFrame by `dish` and compute the average quantity ordered for each dish.
- For each order type, compute the total number of orders (rows).
- What is the overall average `total_price` across all orders?
- Sort the DataFrame by `discounted_price` in descending order and print the top 3 rows.
- Save the DataFrame with your new columns to a new CSV file.
- What happens if you try to group by a column that doesn't exist? Try it and note the error.
- Create a column called `order_label` that is `"big"` if `quantity` ≥ 3, `"medium"` if `quantity` is 2, and `"small"` otherwise.
- Filter the DataFrame to show only orders where `discounted_price` is greater than $20.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- You can compute new columns, update values conditionally, and aggregate data using Pandas.
- These tools let you answer complex questions about your data efficiently.
