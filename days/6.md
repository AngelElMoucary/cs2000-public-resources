## Introduction to Tabular Data

### Day Objectives
- Recognize common examples of tabular data.
- Create tables literally and by importing external data.
- Extract individual rows and cell values.

---

## I. Introduction & Motivation (5 minutes)

- **Overview:** Many everyday datasets — like your workout journal, a recipe index, or a library catalog — are naturally represented as tables, with each entry a row and each attribute a column.
- **Do Now:** Think of three more tabular examples. What are the rows? What are the columns?

## II. Creating Tabular Data (15 minutes)

**A. Literal Tables**

A table literal directly encodes rows and columns in your Pyret program. It’s the simplest way to work with small datasets without external files.
```pyret
table: col1 :: Type1, col1 :: Type1, …  
  row: value1, value2, …  
  row: … 
end
```

After `table:`, list each column name (optionally with :: Type) in the exact order you intend. Each row must supply exactly one value per column, in the same order.

An example of a table that lists workouts can be seen below: 
```pyret
workouts = table: date :: String, activity :: String, duration :: Number
  row: "2025-04-01", "Running", 30
  row: "2025-04-02", "Yoga", 45
  row: "2025-04-03", "Cycling", 60
end
```
The code above defines a table named `workouts` with `date` (String), `activity` (String), and `duration` (Number). It populates 3 rows of data matching that schema.

**Live Demo:**
Enter the people table in the definitions pane and run. In the interactions pane, type people to inspect the resulting table.

Note that column order matters. For example, the test below will pass despite the table having the same data:
```pyret
check:
  table: date :: String, activity :: String, duration :: Number
    row: "2025-04-01", "Running", 30
    row: "2025-04-02", "Yoga", 45
    row: "2025-04-03", "Cycling", 60
  end
  is-not
  table: date :: String, activity :: String, duration :: Number
    row: "2025-04-03", "Cycling", 60
    row: "2025-04-01", "Running", 30
    row: "2025-04-02", "Yoga", 45
  end
end
```

**B. Importing from External Sources**

```pyret
import csv as CSV
# OR include csv
recipes = load-table:
  title :: String,
  servings :: Number,
  prep-time :: Number
  source: CSV.csv-table-file("recipes.csv", CSV.default-options)
end
```

Data from spreadsheets or CSVs load seamlessly into Pyret via `load-table`.

**III. Extracting Rows and Cell Values (15 minutes)**

**A. Row-by-Index**

A table is a collection of Row values. When Pyret displays a Row value, it shows you the column names and the corresponding values within the row.
Note: Pyret numbers rows from 0 (the first row) to n–1 (the last). 

```pyret
second-workout = workouts.row-n(1)
# -> Row: date = "2025-04-02", activity = "Yoga", duration = 45
```
In the example above, `workouts.row-n(1)` dig into the workouts table and extracts the row at index 1. Remember that since rows are zero-indexed, this means that it will extract the second row in the table.

**Live Demo:**
- Enter workouts in the interactions pane and note its value
- Enter workouts.row-n(1) to see the row object
- Ask students: what happens if you try workouts.row-n(3) when only three rows exist?

**B. Accessing Cells**

Often you only need a single piece of information — say, the duration of a workout — rather than the entire row. We can use `row["column-name"]` to extract a single cell. In the example of workouts table, if we'd like to access "Yoga" or 45, we can do so through the code below:

```pyret
second-workout["activity"]  # -> "Yoga"
# or inline:
workouts.row-n(1)["duration"]  # -> 45
```

* **Do Now:** What happens if you write `workouts.row-n(1)[duration]` (without quotes)?
