## Skills: [6](/skills/#(6))

## Pre-reading: [7.1.1](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/trees.html#(part._ancestor-trees)), [7.1.2](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/trees.html#(part._.Programs_to_.Process_.Ancestor_.Trees))

## Intro (10 mins)
- Today we introduce **trees**—a way to represent hierarchical data, where each item can have sub-items.
- Real-world example: an organization chart, where each employee has a name, title, and a (possibly empty) list of direct reports.
- Tables are great for flat data, but struggle to represent nested relationships naturally.
- Example: In a table with columns `name`, `title`, `manager`, it’s easy to find direct reports, but hard to find all indirect reports or the depth of the organization.
- Yesterday, we saw how trees can represent hierarchical data like organizations.
- Today, we’ll see how to define trees as recursive data, and how this lets us write powerful recursive functions.
- Example:
  ```pyret
  data OrgTree:
    | node(name :: String, title :: String, reports :: List<OrgTree>)
  end

  # Example: A small organization
  dave-tree = node("Dave", "Engineer", empty)
  frank-tree = node("Frank", "Engineer", empty)
  bob-tree = node("Bob", "CTO", [list: dave-tree, frank-tree])
  eve-tree = node("Eve", "Accountant", empty)
  carol-tree = node("Carol", "CFO", [list: eve-tree])
  alice-tree = node("Alice", "CEO", [list: bob-tree, carol-tree])
  ```

## Class Exercises (35 mins)
- Given the following table:
  ```pyret
  org-table = table: name, title, manager
    row: "Alice", "CEO", ""
    row: "Bob", "CTO", "Alice"
    row: "Carol", "CFO", "Alice"
    row: "Dave", "Engineer", "Bob"
    row: "Eve", "Accountant", "Carol"
    row: "Frank", "Engineer", "Bob"
  end
  ```
  1. **Direct Reports:** Write an expression to find all direct reports of "Bob".
  2. **Chain of Command:** For "Dave", write an expression to find their manager.
  3. **All Reports (Challenge):** How would you find all people who report (directly or indirectly) to "Alice"? What makes this hard with just tables?
  4. **Tree Structure:** Sketch (on paper) how you would represent this organization as a tree, where each node contains a name, title, and a list of direct reports.
  5. **Tree Data Definition:** Write a Pyret data definition for an OrgTree, where each node has a name, title, and a list of OrgTree direct reports.

Given the `OrgTree` data definition and the example trees above:

1. **Leaf Check:** Write a function `is-leaf` that takes an `OrgTree` and returns `true` if the node has no reports, `false` otherwise.
2. **List All Titles:** Write a function `all-titles` that returns a list of all titles in the organization tree (duplicates are okay).
3. **Count by Title:** Write a function `count-title` that takes an `OrgTree` and a title, and returns the number of employees with that title.
4. **Promote All:** Write a function `promote-all` that takes an `OrgTree` and a function from `String -> String`, and returns a new tree where every title has been updated by the function.
5. **Find Employee:** Write a function `find-employee` that takes an `OrgTree` and a name, and returns the `OrgTree` node for that employee, or `empty` if not found.
6. **Tree Height:** Write a function `org-height` that returns the number of levels in the organization tree (root is level 1).
7. **Find Path to Employee:** Write a function `find-path` that takes an `OrgTree` and a name, and returns a list of names showing the path from the root to that employee (or `empty` if not found).

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Tables are powerful for flat data, but trees are better for representing and processing hierarchical structures.
- Recursive data definitions let us naturally express and process hierarchical data.
- Recursive functions mirror the structure of the data.
- Next time: more tree traversals and transformations.
