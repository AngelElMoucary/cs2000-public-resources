# Variable Scoping and Assignment in Python vs. Pyret

---

## 1. Introduction & The Program Directory (10 minutes)

### A. The Program Directory as a Mental Model
- **Concept Recap:**
  - The “program directory” is our mental model of how a language keeps track of variable names and their associated values.
  - In Pyret, when you write a declaration, an entry is added to this directory.
  - In Python, a similar model exists; we sometimes refer to this as the namespace or program directory.

### B. Key Differences in Declaration and Assignment
- **Pyret:**
  - Variables are declared as either immutable or mutable.
    - Immutable declaration:
      ```pyret
      x = 10
      ```
      This creates an entry for `x` in the program directory that cannot be updated using `:=`.
    - Mutable declaration:
      ```pyret
      var x = 10
      ```
      This creates an entry that you can later update with `:=`.
  - Attempting to update an immutable variable (e.g., writing `x := 20` when x was declared with `x = 10`) will yield an error.

- **Python:**
  - There is no separate syntax for declaration versus assignment. The operator `=` both creates a new binding and updates an existing one.
  - In a function, assigning to a variable creates a new local binding unless you declare it as `global` (or `nonlocal` in nested functions).

### C. Interactive Discussion
- **Question:** “Imagine you have a variable x. In Pyret, what happens if you write `x = 10` and later try to do `x := 20`? What must you do to allow x to be updated?”
- **Expected Answer:**
  - You must declare x as mutable using `var x = 10` to later update it with `:=`.
- **Visualize with the Program Directory:**
  - In Pyret, the directory records an immutable binding for `x` if declared with `x = 10`; it cannot be updated.
  - In Python, the same name x in a given scope will be updated with each assignment (unless shadowed by a local binding).

## 2. Variable Scoping in Python (20 minutes)

### A. Global vs. Local Bindings in Python
- **Example 1: Global Assignment**
  ```python
  x = 10  # x is bound in the global directory

  def show_x():
      return x

  print(show_x())  # prints 10
  ```
  - **Discussion:**
    - The function `show_x` looks up x in the global directory.

- **Example 2: Local Binding and Shadowing**
  ```python
  x = 10

  def change_x():
      x = 20  # This creates a new local variable x, shadowing the global x
      return x

  print(change_x())  # prints 20
  print(x)           # prints 10, because global x remains unchanged
  ```
  - **Interactive Question:**
    - “Why doesn’t change_x() update the global x?”
    - **Answer:** Because assignment in the function creates a new local binding for x.

### B. Using Global and Nonlocal Declarations
- **Example 3: Updating the Global Variable**
  ```python
  x = 10

  def update_global_x():
      global x  # declares that x refers to the global variable
      x = 50

  update_global_x()
  print(x)  # prints 50
  ```
- **Example 4: Nested Functions and nonlocal**
  ```python
  x = 10
  def outer():
      x = 20
      def inner():
          nonlocal x  # refers to x in the outer function
          x = 30
      inner()
      return x
  print(outer())  # prints 30
  print(x)        # prints 10 (global x unchanged)
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Use the program directory model: In Python, each function call creates its own local “directory.”
  - Assignment in an inner function creates a new binding unless you specify `global` or `nonlocal` to refer to an outer binding.

### C. Interactive Exercise
- **Task:**
  - Provide the following code and ask students to predict the output:
    ```python
    y = 100

    def outer():
        y = 200
        def inner():
            y = y + 50  # What happens here?
            return y
        return inner()

    print(outer())
    ```
  - **Expected Discussion:**
    - This will raise an UnboundLocalError because Python sees `y = y + 50` in inner() and treats y as a local variable which is referenced before assignment.
- **Follow-up:**
  - Ask: “How can you fix this so that inner() updates the y from outer()?”
    - **Answer:** Use `nonlocal y` in inner().

## 3. Variable Scoping in Pyret (20 minutes)

### A. Immutable vs. Mutable Declarations in Pyret
- **Example 1: Immutable Declaration**
  ```pyret
  x = 10
  # x is declared immutable. Attempting to update:
  # x := 20  (This would cause an error.)
  ```
- **Example 2: Mutable Declaration**
  ```pyret
  var x = 10
  x := x + 5  # Now x becomes 15.
  x
  ```
  - **Discussion:**
    - Explain that in Pyret, the program directory holds a binding for x. If x is declared immutably (with `x = 10`), it cannot be changed.
    - Using `var x = 10` creates a mutable entry that can later be updated with `:=`.

### B. No Accidental Shadowing in Pyret
- **Explanation:**
  - In Pyret, once a name is declared in a scope, re‑declaring that same name in the same or nested scope is forbidden.
  - This means there is no accidental shadowing—updates are explicit using `:=`.

### C. The Program Directory in Pyret vs. Python
- **Discussion using the Program Directory Model:**
  - **Pyret:**
    - When you write `var x = 10`, the program directory records an entry for x as mutable.
    - Updating x with `x := 20` directly changes that entry.
    - If you try to re‑declare x (e.g., `x = 50`), Pyret raises an error because x is already in the directory.
  - **Python:**
    - When you write `x = 10` at the global level, x is added to the global directory.
    - Inside a function, writing `x = 50` creates a new local entry in that function’s directory, leaving the global unchanged unless you declare `global x`.
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask students to compare what happens in the following cases:
    - In Pyret:
      ```pyret
      y = 20
      y := y + 10
      y
      ```
      versus trying to write
      ```pyret
      y = 20
      y = 30
      ```
      (which causes an error).
    - In Python:
      ```python
      y = 20
      def f():
          y = 30
          return y
      print(f())
      print(y)
      ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Have students describe, using the program directory model, how each language’s approach avoids (or does not avoid) accidental variable changes.

## 4. Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

### A. Recap Key Points
- **Pyret:**
  - Declarations must be marked as mutable (using `var`) if they are to be updated.
  - The operator `=` is only for declaring a name; `:=` is for updating an existing binding.
  - The program directory in Pyret prevents accidental shadowing by not allowing re‑declaration.
- **Python:**
  - Assignment (`=`) both creates and updates bindings.
  - In inner scopes, assignment creates a new local binding unless `global` or `nonlocal` is used.
  - Python’s program directory (namespace) behaves differently: local and global directories exist simultaneously.
