# File I/O and CSV Processing in Python

## 1. Introduction and Motivation (10 minutes)

### A. Overview
- **Context:**  
  - In previous lectures, you learned how high‑level libraries like Pandas work with CSV files. Today, we’ll “go under the hood” and process CSVs manually using basic file I/O, loops, and string methods.
- **Goals:**
  - Learn how to read a text file and convert it into a table-like structure (a list of lists).
  - Perform basic data cleaning and filtering using loops.
  - Write the filtered data back to a new CSV file.
- **Motivating Example:**  
  - Imagine a CSV file called `orders.csv` that contains restaurant orders. Each row has: date, dish, quantity, and order type (e.g., "dine-in" or "takeout").

### B. Why Process CSVs Manually?
- Understand the mechanics behind file reading and writing.
- Gain insight into how libraries like Pandas automate these tasks.

## 2. Reading and Parsing CSV Files Manually (20 minutes)

### A. Reading a File in Python
- **Basic File Reading:**
  - Use the built‑in `open` function and `readlines()` to read the entire file into memory.
  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Open the file for reading
    file = open('orders.csv', 'r')
    lines = file.readlines()   # Read all lines into a list
    file.close()               # Always close the file after reading

    # Print out the raw lines to see what we have
    print(lines)
    ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Explain the purpose of using `open` and `readlines()`.
  - Emphasize the importance of closing the file after use.

### B. Converting Lines to a List of Lists
- **Processing Each Line:**  
  - We need to remove newline characters and split each line by commas.
  - **Step-by-Step Using a Loop (No List Comprehensions):**
    ```python
    # Initialize an empty list to hold our rows
    data = []

    # Process each line using a for loop
    for line in lines:
        # Remove newline characters from the end of the line
        clean_line = line.strip()
        # Split the line into individual cells using a comma as separator
        cells = clean_line.split(',')
        # Append the list of cells to our data list
        data.append(cells)

    # Print the resulting table (list of lists)
    print(data)
    ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask students: “What do you expect to see printed? What does the first row look like (should be the header)?”

### C. Separating Headers from Data
- **Storing Headers and Data Separately:**
  ```python
  # Assume the first row contains the header
  headers = data[0]
  # All subsequent rows are data
  orders = []
  for i in range(1, len(data)):
      orders.append(data[i])
  
  # Print headers and orders separately
  print("Headers:", headers)
  print("Orders:", orders)
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Explain why separating headers from data can be useful for later processing.

### D. Basic Data Cleaning and Filtering
- **Converting String Values to Appropriate Types:**
  - For example, converting the quantity (third column) from string to integer.
  ```python
  for row in orders:
      # Assume quantity is in the third cell (index 2)
      row[2] = int(row[2])
  ```
- **Filtering Rows:**
  - For instance, selecting only orders that are "dine-in".
  ```python
  dine_in_orders = []  # new list for filtered rows
  for row in orders:
      # Assume order type is in the fourth cell (index 3)
      if row[3] == 'dine-in':
          dine_in_orders.append(row)
  
  print("Dine-in Orders:", dine_in_orders)
  ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask: “How many rows do you expect to see if you filter by 'dine-in'? Try running the code.”

## 3. Writing Data Back to a CSV File (20 minutes)

### A. Preparing Data for Output
- **Combining Headers and Filtered Data:**
  ```python
  # Create a new data structure for output: header followed by filtered rows.
  output_data = []
  # Append headers first
  output_data.append(headers)
  # Append each filtered row
  for row in dine_in_orders:
      output_data.append(row)
  ```

### B. Converting Lists to CSV Format
- **Converting Each Row to a String:**
  - We need to join the cells of each row back into a comma-separated string.
  ```python
  output_lines = []  # List to hold string versions of rows

  # Loop over each row in output_data
  for row in output_data:
      # Convert each cell to a string (if not already) and join them with commas
      line = ""
      for i in range(len(row)):
          # Append the cell to the line; add a comma if not the last cell
          line = line + str(row[i])
          if i < len(row) - 1:
              line = line + ","
      # Append the resulting string to output_lines
      output_lines.append(line)
  
  # Print output_lines to see the final CSV-formatted strings
  print(output_lines)
  ```
- **Interactive Discussion:**
  - Ask: “Why do we need to convert each cell to a string? What does the join operation accomplish?”

### C. Writing the Output to a File
- **Using the File Write Process:**
  ```python
  # Open a new file for writing the filtered data
  output_file = open('dine_in_orders.csv', 'w')
  
  # Write each line to the file, adding a newline at the end
  for line in output_lines:
      output_file.write(line + "\n")
  
  output_file.close()
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Explain that the file is created/overwritten and that each line is written with a newline character.
  - Mention that Pandas’ `to_csv` automates these steps for us.

## 4. Wrap-Up  (10 minutes)

### Recap
- We learned how to:
  - Read a CSV file using `open()` and `readlines()`.
  - Process each line by stripping newlines and splitting on commas (using loops, not list comprehensions).
  - Separate headers from data.
  - Clean data by converting string values to proper types.
  - Filter rows using for loops.
  - Convert the processed data back to CSV format by joining cells in each row.
  - Write the final output to a new CSV file.
- **Connection to Pandas:**
  - Manual CSV processing shows the “under the hood” work that Pandas automates (reading, cleaning, filtering, and writing data).
