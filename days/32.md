## Skills: None

## Pre-reading: NEED TO WRITE! -- New section in DCIC about manual file I/O, to supplement existing content loading CSVs from files.

## Intro (10 mins)
- Today we’ll learn how to read and write CSV files "by hand" in Python, using only basic file I/O and string methods—no Pandas.
- This helps you understand what's happening under the hood when you use high-level libraries.
- Example: Reading a CSV file and filtering for dine-in orders.
  ```python
  # Read the file
  # First download the file from the URL:
  # https://pdi.run/f25-restaurant-orders.csv
  # and save it as 'restaurant_orders.csv' in the same directory as this file.
  file = open('restaurant_orders.csv', 'r')
  lines = file.readlines()
  file.close()

  # Convert lines to list of lists
  data = []
  for line in lines:
      cells = line.strip().split(',')
      data.append(cells)

  # Separate header and data
  headers = data[0]
  orders = data[1:]

  # Convert quantity to int and filter for dine-in
  dine_in_orders = []
  for row in orders:
      row[2] = int(row[2])
      if row[3] == 'dine-in':
          dine_in_orders.append(row)

  # Write filtered data to a new CSV
  output = [headers] + dine_in_orders
  out_file = open('dine_in_orders.csv', 'w')
  for row in output:
      out_file.write(','.join([str(cell) for cell in row]) + '\n')
  out_file.close()
  ```
- All of these steps—reading, splitting, cleaning, filtering, and writing—are done manually here, but are automated by Pandas.

## Class Exercises (35 mins)
- Filter the data to include only orders where `order_type` is `"takeout"`. Print the filtered rows.
- Write the filtered data (including the header) to a new CSV file called `takeout_orders.csv`.
- What happens if you forget to close the file after writing? Try it and see if you get an error or warning.
- Add a new column to each row called `total_price` (assume each dish costs $10). Write the updated data to a new CSV file.
- Try reading a CSV file that is missing a column in one row. What happens? How could you handle this?
- Change your code to skip rows that are missing data, and write only the complete rows to a new file.
- Write code to count the total number of orders in the file (excluding the header).
- Write code to count how many orders are for each unique `order_type` (e.g., "dine-in", "takeout").
- Write code to find the dish with the highest total quantity ordered across all rows.
- Write code to filter for orders where `quantity` is greater than 2, and write these rows (with the header) to a new CSV file called `large_orders.csv`.
- Write code to compute the total revenue (sum of `total_price`) for all orders, assuming each dish costs $10.
- Write code to find and print all unique dish names in the file.
- Write code to sort the orders by `quantity` (largest first) and write the sorted data (with header) to a new CSV file.
- Write code to handle a file where some rows are missing the `order_type` column: skip those rows and print a warning for each skipped row.
- (Optional) Write code to add a new column called `order_label` that is `"big"` if `quantity` ≥ 3, `"medium"` if `quantity` is 2, and `"small"` otherwise, and write the updated data to a new CSV file.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Manual file I/O gives you insight into how data is read, cleaned, filtered, and written in Python.
- Libraries like Pandas automate these steps, but it’s important to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.
