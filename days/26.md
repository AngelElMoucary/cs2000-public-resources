## Traversing and Transforming Lists in Python vs. Pyret

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Overview:**
  - Recap the previous lecture on creating and processing lists in Python.
  - Explain that today we focus on traversing lists to compute summary values and to produce new lists.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Understand the use of Python’s imperative for loops for list traversal.
  - Contrast Python’s for loops with both Pyret’s recursive list processing and its `for each` loops.
- **Do Now:**
  - Ask: “How would you sum a list of numbers in Pyret using recursion? How about using a for‑each loop?”
  - Quick discussion.

### 2. Traversing Lists Using For Loops in Python
- **Example: Summing a List**
  - **Python Code:**
    ```python
    def sum_list(num_list: list) -> float:
        run_total = 0
        for num in num_list:
            run_total = run_total + num
        return run_total
    ```
  - **Discussion:**
    - Compare with Pyret’s `for each` version:
    ```pyret
    fun sum-list(num-list: List<Number>) -> Number block:
        var run-total = 0
        for each(num from num-list):
            run-total := run-total + num
        end
        run-total
    end
    ```
        
    - And Pyret's recursive version:
      ```pyret
      fun sum-list(numlist :: List<Number>) -> Number:
        cases (List) numlist:
          | empty => 0
          | link(fst, rst) => fst + sum-list(rst)
        end
      end
      ```
- **Order of Processing:**
  - Discuss that Python’s for loop processes elements in order (left-to-right) and that this may differ from a recursive approach that “unrolls” from the base case upward.
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask students to trace `sum_list([5, 2, 7, 3])` by listing the successive values of `run_total`.

### 3. Producing New Lists via For Loops
- **Example: Extracting Words Containing “z”**
  - **Python Code:**
    ```python
    def all_z_words(word_list: list) -> list:
        z_list = []  # start with an empty list
        for wd in word_list:
            if "z" in wd:
                # Prepend wd (or append if preferred)
                z_list = [wd] + z_list
        return z_list
    ```
  - **Discussion:**
    - Compare with a Pyret version using `for each`:
      ```pyret
      fun all-z-words(wordlist :: List<String>) -> List<String>:
        var result = empty
        for each(wd from wordlist):
          if string-contains(wd, "z"):
            result := [list: wd] + result
          end
        end
        result
      end
      ```
  - **Interactive Exercise:**
    - Ask: “What order will the words appear in? How might you modify the code to preserve the original order?”
- **Additional Topic:**
  - Briefly mention that while Python’s for loops work well for linear lists, they cannot directly traverse non-linear (tree) data without additional structure.

### 4. Summary: List-Processing Templates in Python vs. Pyret
- **Template for Python List Processing:**
  - **General Template:**
    ```python
    def func(lst: list):
        result = <base_value>
        for item in lst:
            result = <combine>(item, result)
        return result
    ```
  - This can be directly translated to Pyret's `for each` loops.
  - Compare with Pyret’s recursive template:
    ```pyret
    fun func(lst :: List<T>) -> R:
      cases (List) lst:
        | empty => <base_value>
        | link(first, rest) => <combine>(first, func(rest))
      end
    end
    ```
  - The recursive template is more general, as it will work with data like trees.
- **Discussion:**
  - Emphasize that Python’s imperative style uses mutable variables and explicit
    for loops, Pyret can do this with `for each`, but also has good support for
    recursion.
- **Do Now (Reflection):**
  - Ask students: “Which approach do you find more intuitive for list processing and why?”

### 5. Wrap-Up and Exit (10 minutes)
- **Recap Key Points:**
  - We have seen three ways to process lists:
    - Recursively (Pyret style using cases),
    - Imperatively (Pyret using for‑each loops), and
    - Imperatively in Python (using for loops and mutable accumulators).
  - Each student writes a short paragraph (3–4 sentences) comparing the recursive approach in Pyret with the for loop approach in Python for list processing, noting strengths and weaknesses.
