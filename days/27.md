## Skills: [10](/skills/#(10))

## Pre-reading: [11.1](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/unified-state.html), [11.2](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/unified-equality.html)

## Intro (10 mins)
- Today we explore how variable assignment, mutability, and scoping work in Pyret and Python, and how equality works in both languages.
- **Pyret: Mutable vs Immutable**
  ```pyret
  x = 10
  # x := 20   # Error: x is immutable

  var y = 5
  y := y + 2  # y is now 7

  # Can't re-declare a name in the same scope:
  y = 20      # Error!
  ```
- **Python: Assignment and Scoping**
  ```python
  x = 10
  x = 20  # x is now 20

  y = 5
  y = y + 2  # y is now 7

  # Scoping example:
  y = 20
  def f():
      y = 30  # This is a new local y, does not affect global y
      return y
  print(f())  # prints 30
  print(y)    # prints 20

  # Using global:
  z = 100
  def g():
      global z
      z = 200
  g()
  print(z)    # prints 200
  ```
- **Equality:**
  - In Python, `==` checks value equality, `is` checks object identity.
    ```python
    [1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]  # True
    [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3]  # False
    x = [1, 2, 3]
    y = x
    x is y  # True, same object in memory
    ```
  - This is different from Pyret, where `is` shows up only in _tests_, where it checks that values are always the same (so they are either immutable and equal as values, or if mutable, are the same objects). This is the _same_ as what `==` does in Pyret. Pyret has other forms of equality (`equal-now`, `identical`), but we don't cover them in this class.

## Class Exercises (35 mins)
- Given this Python code, predict what will print and explain why:
     ```python
     y = 100
     def outer():
         y = 200
         def inner():
             y = y + 50
             return y
         return inner()
     print(outer())
     ```
- Fix the code so that `inner()` updates the `y` from `outer()`.

- Given this Pyret code, predict what will print and explain why:
  ```pyret
  x = 10
  fun f() block:
    x := x + 5
    x
  end
  f()
  ```
- Fix the code so that `f()` updates `x` correctly.

- Given this Python code, predict what will print and explain why:
  ```python
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  b = a
  b.append(4)
  print(a)
  ```
- Explain how mutability affects the behavior of `a` and `b`.
- What would happen if you did `b = b + [5]` instead of `b.append(4)`? Does `a` change? Why or why not?
- Given this Python code, predict what will print and explain why:
  ```python
  nums = [1, 2, 3]
  def add_num(lst):
      lst.append(4)
  add_num(nums)
  print(nums)
  ```
- What would happen if you did `lst = lst + [5]` inside `add_num` instead of `lst.append(4)`? Does `nums` change? Why or why not?
- Given this Python code, predict what will print and explain why:
  ```python
  x = 10
  def foo():
      x = x + 1
      return x
  print(foo())
  ```
- Fix the above code so that it increments the global `x`.
- Given this Pyret code, predict what will print and explain why:
  ```pyret
  var a = 10
  fun inc() block:
    a := a + 1
    a
  end
  inc()
  a
  ```
- What happens if you try to use `a = 20` after declaring `var a = 10` in Pyret? Why?
- Given this Python code, predict what will print and explain why:
  ```python
  def compare_lists(lst1, lst2):
      return lst1 == lst2
  print(compare_lists([1, 2], [1, 2]))
  print(compare_lists([1, 2], [2, 1]))
  ```


## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Pyret and Python handle assignment, mutability, and scoping differently.
- Understanding these differences helps avoid bugs and write clearer code.
