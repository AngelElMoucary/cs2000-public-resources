## Pre-reading: [10.1.1]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#(part._.Pandas_.Table_.Basics)), [10.1.2]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#%28part._.Filtering_.Rows%29), [10.1.3]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#(part._.Cleaning_and_.Normalizing_.Data))

## Intro (10 mins)
- Today we introduce **Pandas**, a popular Python library for working with tables (which they call DataFrames).
- A **DataFrame** is a table with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or a Pyret table.
- A **Series** is a single column (or row) of data from a DataFrame.
- Example: Restaurant orders table, with columns for date, dish, quantity, and order type.
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  data = {
      'date': ['2023-07-01', '2023-07-01', '2023-07-02', '2023-07-02', '2023-07-03'],
      'dish': ['Pasta', 'Salad', 'Burger', 'Pasta', 'Steak'],
      'quantity': [2, 1, 3, 2, 1],
      'order_type': ['dine-in', 'takeout', 'dine-in', 'dine-in', 'takeout']
  }
  orders = pd.DataFrame(data)
  print(orders)
  ```
- You can also load data from a CSV file (locally or, as shown here, from a URL):
  ```python
  orders = pd.read_csv("https://pdi.run/f25-restaurant-orders.csv")
  ```
- Access columns by label: `orders['dish']`, rows by index: `orders.iloc[2]`.
- Filtering: Use "boolean masks" (which look like ordinary boolean expressions, but the left side looks like a column, but the right is a value -- Pandas does special things to make this work) to select rows, e.g.:
  ```python
  dine_in_orders = orders[orders['order_type'] == 'dine-in']
  ```
- Cleaning: Replace missing values (NaN) with a default:
  ```python
  orders['order_type'] = orders['order_type'].fillna('unknown')
  ```
- All of these operations are similar to what you did with tables in Pyret, but with different syntax and, more complexity (though also, more power).

## Class Exercises (35 mins)
- Load a CSV file (either from a URL or local file) into a DataFrame. Consider using an example from earlier in class. Print the first 5 rows.
- Create a DataFrame manually with at least 5 rows and columns: `date`, `dish`, `quantity`, `order_type`.
- Access the `dish` column and print all unique dish names.
- What does `orders['quantity'][1]` return? Try it and explain.
- Filter the DataFrame to show only orders where `order_type` is `"takeout"`.
- Replace all missing values in the `order_type` column with `"unknown"`.
- Filter the DataFrame to show only orders where `quantity` is greater than 1.
- What does `orders[orders['dish'] == 'Pasta']` return? Try it and explain.
- Filter the DataFrame to show only orders from a specific date (e.g., `"2023-07-02"`).
- What happens if you try to access a column that doesn't exist? Try it and note the error.
- Try sorting the DataFrame by `quantity` in descending order.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Pandas DataFrames let you work with tables in Python, similar to Pyret tables but with more features.
- You can create, load, clean, filter, and manipulate tabular data efficiently.
