## Skills: None

## Pre-reading: [10.1.1]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#(part._.Pandas_.Table_.Basics)), [10.1.2]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#%28part._.Filtering_.Rows%29), [10.1.3]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/python-tables-Pandas.html#(part._.Cleaning_and_.Normalizing_.Data))

## Intro (10 mins)
Today we learn **Pandas**, Python's library for working with tables (called DataFrames). Everything you learned about Pyret tables has a Pandas equivalent, but with different syntax.

**Creating tables literally** (like Pyret's `table: ... row: ... end`):
```python
# Pyret way:
# orders = table: date, dish, quantity, order_type
#   row: "2023-07-01", "Pasta", 2, "dine-in"
#   row: "2023-07-01", "Salad", 1, "takeout"
# end

# Pandas way -- note that data is given column by column, rather than row by row.
import pandas as pd
data = {
    'date': ['2023-07-01', '2023-07-01', '2023-07-02'],
    'dish': ['Pasta', 'Salad', 'Burger'],
    'quantity': [2, 1, 3],
    'order_type': ['dine-in', 'takeout', 'dine-in']
}
orders = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

**Loading from CSV** (like Pyret's `load-table: ... source: csv-table-url(...)`):
```python
# Pyret way:
# orders = load-table: date, dish, quantity, order_type
#   source: csv-table-url("https://pdi.run/f25-restaurant-orders.csv", default-options)
# end

# Pandas way -- note that it automatically infers columns names.
orders = pd.read_csv("https://pdi.run/f25-restaurant-orders.csv")
```

**Accessing data** (like Pyret's `.row-n(N)` and `row["column"]`):
```python
# Pyret way:
# orders.row-n(1)["dish"]

# Pandas way:
orders.iloc[1]         # Get row by index (like .row-n)
orders.iloc[1]['dish'] # Get single value from row (like .row-n(1)["dish"])
```

**Extracting columns as lists** (like Pyret's `.get-column()`):
```python
# Pyret way:
# quantities = orders.get-column("quantity")  # Extract column as list

# Pandas way:
quantities = orders['quantity'] # Extract column as Series -- not quite a list, but similar
```

**Built-in statistics** (like Pyret's `mean(table, "column")`):
```python
# Pyret way:
# mean(orders, "quantity")    # Direct table operation
# sum(orders, "quantity")     # Direct table operation

# Pandas way:
orders['quantity'].mean()     # Series operation
orders['quantity'].sum()      # Series operation
```

## Class Exercises (35 mins)
**Creating and loading tables:**
- Create a DataFrame manually with workout data: columns `date`, `activity`, `duration`. Make at least 5 rows.
- Load the CSV from https://pdi.run/f25-2000-photos.csv into a DataFrame. Print the first 5 rows.

**Accessing data:**
- Get the second row from your workout DataFrame (remember: Python uses 0-based indexing).
- Extract the `activity` column and print all unique activity names.
- Get the duration value from the third workout (combining row and column access).
- What happens if you try to access a row that doesn't exist? Try it and note the error.
- What happens if you try to access a column that doesn't exist? Try it and note the error.

**Extracting columns and statistics:**
- Extract the `duration` column from your workout DataFrame and store it in a variable called `durations`.
- Work with the `durations` Series to find: `.mean()`, `.sum()`, `.max()`, `.min()`.
- Calculate the range (difference between max and min) of workout durations.
- For the photos dataset, extract a numeric column and calculate its median using `.median()`.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Pandas DataFrames provide the same basic table operations you learned in Pyret Day 7: creating tables, loading from CSV, accessing rows/columns, and computing statistics.
- The syntax is different, but the concepts are identical. Tomorrow we'll see filtering, sorting, and column operations.
