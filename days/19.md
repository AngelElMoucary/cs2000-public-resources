## Intro (10 mins)
- Sometimes, rather than data being composed of different parts, as we saw [last
  time](/days/17), data comes in multiple, incompatible, forms. 
- For example, a payment system might need to track the source of payment, which
  could be:
  - Cash, with no further information
  - Check, with the bank account number and routing number (and possibly more information -- account number, check number, etc)
  - Credit Card, with the credit card number (and possibly more information -- expiration date, security code, etc)
- This doesn't fit into the pattern of structured data, since different
  alternatives have different, incompatible, components. A security code makes
  no sense for a check, and a check number has no bearing on a credit card, and
  all of the extra fields make no sense for cash. 
- Instead, this type of data is conditional -- data that takes the shape of
  exactly one of several variants. 
- We can define the above using the same `data` mechanism:
  ```pyret
  data PaymentMethod:
    | cash
    | credit(card-number :: String, expiry :: String)
    | check(bank-account :: String, routing :: String, check-number :: Number)
  end
  ```
- Note that there is _one_ data type `PaymentMethod`, but _three_ ways of
  constructing it -- `cash`, `credit`, and `check`. 
- We create examples of this data similarly to how we did with structured data:
  ```pyret
  payment-1 = cash
  payment-2 = credit("1111-2222-3333-4444", "09/26")
  payment-3 = check("987654321", "111", 55)
  ```
- To _use_ conditional data, however, we can't use the dot notation for field lookup, like with structured data, 
  since given a `PaymentMethod`, we don't know which variant we have! Instead, we use a 
  new language feature called `cases`, which allows you to write down what to do in each possible case
  of the data, creating names for fields in the variants that have fields:
  ```pyret
    fun display-payment(p :: PaymentMethod) -> String:
      cases (PaymentMethod) p:
        | cash => "Paid in cash"
        | credit(cn, exp) => "Paid by credit card " + string-from-number(string-length(cn))
        | check(acc, rout, num) => "Paid by check from account " + acc
      end
    end
    ```
