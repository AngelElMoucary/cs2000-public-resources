# Python Dictionaries vs. Dataclasses

## 1. Introduction and Motivation (10 minutes)

### A. Overview
- **Context:**
  - Today we’re exploring dictionaries in Python, a fundamental data structure that maps unique keys to values.
- **Motivating Example:**
  - We’ll work with conference session data. Each session has a unique session ID, a title, a speaker, and a list of topics covered.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Learn how to create and use dictionaries in Python.
  - Practice searching and filtering through dictionary values.
  - Compare dictionaries with dataclasses (which provide a fixed, type‑checked structure).

### B. The Program Directory Model
- **Mental Model:**
  - Think of the program directory as a mapping from names (or keys) to values. In a dictionary, keys (e.g., session IDs) are associated with their corresponding values (e.g., session details).
- **Preview:**
  - We’ll see how this model makes lookups fast and flexible, and we’ll compare this with dataclasses, which have fixed fields.

## 2. Creating and Using a Dictionary (15 minutes)

### A. Creating a Dictionary for Conference Sessions
- **Example Scenario:**
  - Each session is uniquely identified by a session ID.
- **Python Code Example:**
  ```python
  # Create a dictionary that maps session IDs to session details.
  # Each session is represented as a tuple: (title, speaker, topics)
  sessions_dict = {
      "CS101": ("Introduction to AI", "Dr. Martinez", ["AI", "Machine Learning"]),
      "CS102": ("Deep Learning Techniques", "Prof. Nguyen", ["Neural Networks", "Deep Learning"]),
      "CS103": ("Quantum Computing Basics", "Dr. Patel", ["Quantum", "Computing"]),
      "CS104": ("Cybersecurity Trends", "Ms. Lee", ["Security", "Networking"])
  }
  print(sessions_dict)
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Explain that keys (e.g., `"CS101"`) uniquely identify sessions.
  - Note that the values can be simple tuples or more complex data structures.

### B. Accessing and Updating Dictionary Values
- **Accessing a Session:**
  ```python
  # Lookup the session details for "CS102"
  session_details = sessions_dict["CS102"]
  print("Session CS102 details:", session_details)
  ```
- **Updating a Session:**
  - Suppose the speaker for session CS103 changes:
    ```python
    sessions_dict["CS103"] = ("Quantum Computing Basics", "Dr. Singh", ["Quantum", "Computing"])
    print("Updated CS103:", sessions_dict["CS103"])
    ```
- **Interactive Question:**
  - Ask: “What happens if you try to access a session ID that does not exist? (Answer: A KeyError is raised.)”

## 3. Searching Through the Values in a Dictionary (15 minutes)

### A. Iterating Over a Dictionary
- **Looping Over Keys to Find Sessions by Topic:**
  ```python
  # Create an empty dictionary to hold sessions covering 'AI'
  ai_sessions = {}

  # Loop over each key in sessions_dict
  for session_id in sessions_dict:
      # Get the details for the current session
      details = sessions_dict[session_id]
      # Check if 'AI' is one of the topics
      # (Assume topics are stored in a list in the third element of the tuple)
      if "AI" in details[2]:
          ai_sessions[session_id] = details

  print("Sessions covering AI:", ai_sessions)
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Explain that we iterated over the dictionary keys, checked each session’s topics, and built a new dictionary of sessions that meet our criterion.
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask: “How would you find all sessions where the speaker’s name starts with 'Dr.'?”
  - Encourage students to outline a similar loop that checks `details[1]`.

## 4. Dictionaries with More Complex Values and Comparing with Dataclasses (10 minutes)

### A. Dictionaries with Complex Values
- **Example: Conference Sessions with Detailed Records**
  - Instead of simple tuples, we can store each session as a dictionary:
    ```python
    sessions_dict = {
        "CS101": {"title": "Introduction to AI", "speaker": "Dr. Martinez", "topics": ["AI", "Machine Learning"]},
        "CS102": {"title": "Deep Learning Techniques", "speaker": "Prof. Nguyen", "topics": ["Neural Networks", "Deep Learning"]},
        "CS103": {"title": "Quantum Computing Basics", "speaker": "Dr. Patel", "topics": ["Quantum", "Computing"]},
        "CS104": {"title": "Cybersecurity Trends", "speaker": "Ms. Lee", "topics": ["Security", "Networking"]}
    }
    print(sessions_dict)
    ```
- **Accessing Complex Data:**
  ```python
  # Retrieve the speaker for session CS104
  speaker = sessions_dict["CS104"]["speaker"]
  print("Speaker for CS104:", speaker)
  ```

### B. Dictionaries versus Dataclasses
- **Dataclasses Recap (Brief):**
  - You have seen dataclasses before. For instance:
    ```python
    from dataclasses import dataclass

    @dataclass
    class ConferenceSession:
        session_id: str
        title: str
        speaker: str
        topics: list

    session1 = ConferenceSession("CS101", "Introduction to AI", "Dr. Martinez", ["AI", "Machine Learning"])
    ```
- **Comparison:**
  - **Dictionaries:**
    - More flexible: You can add or remove keys dynamically.
    - No built‑in type checking; keys are accessed via strings.
    - Great for ad‑hoc or variable structures.
  - **Dataclasses:**
    - Fixed structure with type hints.
    - Easier for error checking and enforcing a consistent schema.
    - Less flexible if you need to add optional or variable fields.
- **Interactive Discussion:**
  - Ask: “What are some advantages of using a dataclass over a dictionary for representing conference sessions? And vice versa?”

## 5. Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

### Recap
- **Dictionaries:**
  - Map unique keys (such as session IDs) to values.
  - Allow fast lookup and flexible updating.
  - Can store simple or complex values (e.g., tuples, nested dictionaries, lists).
- **Dataclasses:**
  - Provide a fixed, type‑checked structure for compound data.
  - Offer clarity and safety but are less flexible than dictionaries.
- **When to Use Which:**
  - Use dictionaries when you need dynamic, fast lookups (e.g., finding a session by ID).
  - Use dataclasses when you want a clear, consistent record structure with type checking.
