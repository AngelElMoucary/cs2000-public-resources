## Intro (15 mins)

- Today we explore **dictionaries** in Python, a data structure that maps unique keys to values.
- Dictionaries are useful for fast lookups and flexible data storage, while dataclasses provide a fixed, type-checked structure.
- Example: Conference session data, where each session has a unique session ID, a title, a speaker, and a list of topics.
  ```python
  # Dictionary mapping session IDs to session details (as dictionaries)
  sessions = {
      "CS101": {"title": "Introduction to AI", "speaker": "Dr. Martinez", "topics": ["AI", "Machine Learning"]},
      "CS102": {"title": "Deep Learning Techniques", "speaker": "Prof. Nguyen", "topics": ["Neural Networks", "Deep Learning"]},
      "CS103": {"title": "Quantum Computing Basics", "speaker": "Dr. Patel", "topics": ["Quantum", "Computing"]},
      "CS104": {"title": "Cybersecurity Trends", "speaker": "Ms. Lee", "topics": ["Security", "Networking"]}
  }
  print(sessions["CS101"]["speaker"])  # Dr. Martinez
  ```
- You can update values, add new keys, or remove keys:
  ```python
  sessions["CS103"]["speaker"] = "Dr. Singh"
  sessions["CS105"] = {"title": "Data Ethics", "speaker": "Dr. Kim", "topics": ["Ethics", "Data"]}
  del sessions["CS104"]
  ```
- If you try to access a key that doesn't exist, you'll get a `KeyError`. You can use `.get()` to avoid this:
  ```python
  print(sessions.get("CS999", "Not found"))  # Not found
  ```
- You can iterate through a dictionary to search or filter:
  ```python
  # Print all session IDs for sessions covering "AI"
  for session_id, details in sessions.items():
      if "AI" in details["topics"]:
          print(session_id)

  # Count how many sessions have a speaker whose name starts with "Dr."
  count = 0
  for details in sessions.values():
      if details["speaker"].startswith("Dr."):
          count += 1
  print(count)
  ```
- You can collect all unique topics (using a list and checking for duplicates):
  ```python
  unique_topics = []
  for details in sessions.values():
      for topic in details["topics"]:
          if topic not in unique_topics:
              unique_topics.append(topic)
  print(unique_topics)
  ```
- Dictionaries vs. dataclasses:
  ```python
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  @dataclass
  class ConferenceSession:
      session_id: str
      title: str
      speaker: str
      topics: list

  session1 = ConferenceSession("CS101", "Introduction to AI", "Dr. Martinez", ["AI", "Machine Learning"])
  ```
- Dictionaries are flexible and dynamic; dataclasses are fixed and type-checked.

## Class Exercises (40 mins)

- Create a dictionary mapping student IDs to names. Add a new student, update a name, and remove a student.
- Given a dictionary of conference sessions (as above), print all session IDs for sessions covering "AI".
- Count how many sessions have a speaker whose name starts with "Dr.".
- Add a new topic to the list of topics for a given session.
- What happens if you try to access a session that doesn't exist? How can you avoid a crash?
- Write a function that takes a dictionary of sessions and returns a list of all unique topics covered.
- Convert a list of `ConferenceSession` dataclass instances into a dictionary mapping session IDs to dataclass instances.
- Filter all sessions where the number of topics is greater than 1.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)

- Dictionaries map unique keys to values and are flexible for dynamic data.
- Dataclasses provide a fixed, type-checked structure.
