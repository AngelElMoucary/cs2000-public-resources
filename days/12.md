## Intro (25 min)
- Consider you have a small cafe that tracks daily sales, where each row has the
  number of drinks sold:
  ```pyret
  cafe-data =
    table: day, drinks-sold
      row: "Mon", 45
      row: "Tue", 30
      row: "Wed", 55
      row: "Thu", 40
      row: "Fri", 60
    end
  ```
- There are many basic statistical questions we might want to ask -- e.g., what
  is the maximum number of drinks sold, the average sold per day, or the total
  sold.
- We can extract single _columns_ from tables, and then use standard
  operations from two different software libraries -- `math` and `statistics`
  -- to operate over those columns. 
  ```pyret
  import math as M
  import statistics as S

  sales = cafe-data.get-column("drinks-sold")
  M.max(sales)      # maximum sales
  S.mean(sales)     # average sales
  M.sum(sales)      # total sold
  ```
- Here, `import math as M` declares that you want to use code that comes from
  Pyret's `math` library (https://pyret.org/docs/latest/math.html), and in order
  to not get confused between the functions provided from it and the functions
  available by default or defined by you, the `as M` gives the library a short
  name. This means that any function `function-name` from the `math` library is
  availabe as `M.function-name`. The choice `M` is arbitrary -- but convention
  is to use capital letters, and usually just one or two.
- If you aren't worried about mixing up functions from the library, you can
  instead write:
  ```pyret
  include math
  ```
  This adds all the functions from the `math` library to the current program directory 
  with no change of name, so we could write the above alternately as:
  ```pyret
  include math
  include statistics

  sales = cafe-data.get-column("drinks-sold")
  max(sales)      # maximum sales
  mean(sales)    # average sales
  sum(sales)     # total  sold
  ```
  This is more concise but possibly a little harder to read, as someone has 
  to figure out that `max` and `sum` from from `math` but `mean` comes from `statistics`, 
  which is not obvious from reading the code in the way it was when we used 
  the `import` form.
- A column is a type of data called a `list` -- if we print it out we can see
  that it looks like:
  ```pyret
  cafe-data.get-column("drinks-sold")
  ```
  This shows at the interactions as:
  ```pyret
  [list: 45, 30, 55, 40, 60]
  ```
- Lists have order, but no column header, and unlike tables, only a single value
  per entry
- We can define lists directly using the above syntax:
  ```pyret
  sample-list = [list: 10, 20, 30]
  empty-list = [list: ]
  ```
- And lists can have any type of data in them. On lists of _numbers_ we can use
  functions from `math` and `statistics` on them. 
  
  
## Class Exercise (30 min)

FIXME / TODO


## Wrap-Up (5 min)
- Columns can be extracted from tables -- these are lists. 
- Many built in functions work on lists of values.
