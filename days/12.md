## Basic Statistical Questions, Extracting Columns, and Understanding Lists

**Focus:** Introduce basic statistical queries over tables, show how to extract a column from a table, and explain what lists are and how to create them.

### 1. Introduction & Motivation (10 minutes)
- **Context:**  
  Imagine you run a small café that tracks daily sales in a table. Each day’s entry includes the number of coffees sold.
- **Discussion Prompt (Do Now):**  
  - “What basic statistics might you want to know about your daily coffee sales? (e.g., maximum, average, total)”  
  - Have students share ideas.

### 2. Basic Statistical Questions on a Table (15 minutes)
- **New Example Table:**  
  We define a simple table of daily coffee sales.
  ```pyret
  coffee-sales =
    table: day, coffees-sold
      row: "Mon", 45
      row: "Tue", 30
      row: "Wed", 55
      row: "Thu", 40
      row: "Fri", 60
    end
  ```
- **Statistical Questions:**  
  - Largest number sold on a day (maximum)
  - Average coffees sold per day (mean)
  - Total coffees sold (sum)
- **Interactive Coding:**  
  - Ask students: “How would you compute the average number of coffees sold?”  
  - Introduce Pyret’s math/statistics libraries:
    ```pyret
    import math as M
    import statistics as S

    sales = coffee-sales.get-column("coffees-sold")
    M.max(sales)      // maximum sales
    S.mean(sales)     // average sales
    M.sum(sales)      // total coffees sold
    ```
  - NEED TO DISCUSS `import`, module names, etc.
- **Discussion:**  
  - Which statistic might best help you plan staffing on a busy day?

### 3. Extracting a Column & Transition to Lists (15 minutes)
- **Extracting the Column:**  
  - Use the function `get-column`:
    ```pyret
    coffee-sales.get-column("coffees-sold")
    ```
  - Show that the result is printed as:
    ```
    [list: 45, 30, 55, 40, 60]
    ```
- **Discussion:**  
  - How does a list differ from a table? (Lists have order but no column header, and only _single_ value per entry.)
- **Creating Literal Lists:**  
  - Explain that lists can be defined directly:
    ```pyret
    sample-list = [list: 10, 20, 30]
    empty-list = [list: ]
    ```
  - **Do Now:**  
    - Ask: “How would you create a list of weekdays? (Answer: `[list: "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"]`)”

### 4. Wrap-Up & Reflection (10 minutes)
- **Recap Key Points:**  
  - How to ask basic statistical questions on a table.
  - How to extract a column to obtain a list.
  - The notion that a list is an ordered, anonymous collection of values.
