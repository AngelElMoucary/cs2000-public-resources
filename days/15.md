# Iterative List Processing with `for each` Loops and Variables

## 1. Review: Variables, Mutation, and `for each` Loops (10 minutes)

### A. Variables and Mutation

- **Mutable Variables in Pyret:**
  - Declare mutable variables with `var` and update them with `:=`.
  - **Example:**
    ```pyret
    var total = 0
    spy: total end
    total := total + 5
    spy: total end
    ```
  - **Key Point:** When you update a variable with `:=`, its binding in the directory changes to the new value.

### B. The `for each` Loop

- **Syntax and Purpose:**
  - Pyret’s `for each` loop iterates over every element of a list, performing side‑effects (such as updating a variable).
  - **Syntax:**
    ```pyret
    for each(elem from some-list):
      <body that uses elem>
    end
    ```
- **Example – Summing Numbers:**
  ```pyret
  var sum = 0
  for each(n from [list: 0, 1, 2, 3]):
    sum := sum + n
  end
  check:
    sum is 6
  end
  ```

### C. Multi‑Statement Function Bodies with `block:`

- **Important Syntax Rule:**
  - When a function body contains more than one statement, you must begin the body with `block:`.
  - **Example:**
    ```pyret
    fun my-len(l :: List<Any>) -> Number block:
      var count = 0
      for each(elem from l):
        count := count + 1
      end
      count
    end
    ```

## 2. Structural Problems with Scalar Answers (20 minutes)

TODO: REPLACE THIS WITH A DIFFERENT EXAMPLE! WE JUST DID THIS!

### A. Implementing `my-sum` (Sum of Numbers)

- **Problem:** Compute the sum of a list of numbers.
- **Iterative Strategy:**
  - Use a mutable variable `total` starting at 0.
  - For each number in the list, add it to `total`.
- **Code:**
  ```pyret
  fun my-sum(l :: List<Number>) -> Number block:
    var total = 0
    for each(n from l):
      total := total + n
    end
    total
  end
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - “Predict the output of `my-sum([list: 7, 8, 9])`.”
  - *Expected answer: 24*

## 3. Structural Problems that Transform or Select from Lists (20 minutes)

### A. Implementing `my-doubles` (Doubling Each Element)

- **Problem:** Produce a new list with each number doubled.
- **Iterative Strategy:**
  - Initialize a mutable variable `result` as `empty`.
  - For each element in the input list, append its doubled value using the list concatenation operator `+`.
- **Code:**
  ```pyret
  fun my-doubles(l :: List<Number>) -> List<Number> block:
    var result = empty
    for each(n from l):
      result := result + [list: n * 2]
    end
    result
  end
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - “What is `my-doubles([list: 3, 5, 2])`?”
  - *Expected answer: `[list: 6, 10, 4]`*

### B. Implementing `my-str-len` (String Lengths)

- **Problem:** Given a list of strings, return a list of their lengths.
- **Iterative Strategy:**
  - Use a mutable variable `result` initialized to `empty`.
  - For each string, calculate `string-length(s)` and append it.
- **Code:**
  ```pyret
  fun my-str-len(l :: List<String>) -> List<Number> block:
    var result = empty
    for each(s from l):
      result := result + [list: string-length(s)]
    end
    result
  end
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - “Test `my-str-len([list: "hi", "there", "mateys"])`.”
  - *Expected answer: `[list: 2, 5, 6]`*

### C. Implementing `my-pos-nums` (Selecting Positive Numbers)

- **Problem:** Return a list containing only the positive numbers.
- **Iterative Strategy:**
  - Use a mutable variable `result` starting as `empty`.
  - For each number, if it is greater than 0, append it using `+`.
- **Code:**
  ```pyret
  fun my-pos-nums(l :: List<Number>) -> List<Number> block:
    var result = empty
    for each(n from l):
      when n > 0:
        result := result + [list: n]
      end
    end
    result
  end
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - “What is `my-pos-nums([list: 1, -2, 3, -4])`?”
  - *Expected answer: `[list: 1, 3]`*

### D. Implementing `my-alternating` (Selecting Every Other Element)

- **Problem:** Return a list of alternating elements (keep the first, skip the second, etc.).
- **Iterative Strategy:**
  - Declare a mutable variable `result` (initially `empty`) and a Boolean `keep` (initially `true`).
  - For each element in the list, if `keep` is true, append it using `+`, then toggle `keep` (i.e., `keep := not(keep)`).
- **Code:**
  ```pyret
  fun my-alternating(l :: List<Any>) -> List<Any> block:
    var result = empty
    var keep = true
    for each(elem from l):
      when keep:
        result := result + [list: elem]
      end
      keep := not(keep)
    end
    result
  end
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - “Test `my-alternating([list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`. What do you get?”
  - *Expected answer: `[list: 1, 3, 5]`*

## 4. Wrap-Up and Discussion (5 minutes)

- **Key Points Review:**
  - We use mutable variables (declared with `var` and updated with `:=`) as accumulators.
  - The `for each` loop iterates over each element in a list.
  - When a function’s body has multiple statements, we begin with `block:` to indicate a sequence of statements.
  - To append two lists, we use the `+` operator (e.g., `result + [list: value]`).

---

## 5. Optional Challenge (if time permits)

- **Challenge Exercise – `my-running-sum`:**
  - Write a function that computes the running sum of a list of numbers.
  - **Iterative Strategy:**
    - Use a mutable variable `acc` (initialized to 0) and `result` (initialized to `empty`).
    - For each number, update `acc` with `acc := acc + n` and then append `acc` to `result` using `+`.
- **Code Example:**
  ```pyret
  fun my-running-sum(l :: List<Number>) -> List<Number> block:
    var result = empty
    var acc = 0
    for each(n from l):
      acc := acc + n
      result := result + [list: acc]
    end
    result
  end
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - “What is `my-running-sum([list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`?”
  - *Expected answer: `[list: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15]`*
