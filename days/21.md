## Skills: None

## Pre-reading: [7.1.1](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/trees.html#(part._ancestor-trees))

# TODO expand this -- and maybe don't start with an n-ary tree.

## Intro (10 mins)
- Today we introduce **trees**—a way to represent hierarchical data, where each item can have sub-items.
- Real-world example: an organization chart, where each employee has a name, title, and a (possibly empty) list of direct reports.
- Tables are great for flat data, but struggle to represent nested relationships naturally.
- Example: In a table with columns `name`, `title`, `manager`, it’s easy to find direct reports, but hard to find all indirect reports or the depth of the organization.

## Class Exercises (35 mins)
- Given the following table:
  ```pyret
  org-table = table: name, title, manager
    row: "Alice", "CEO", ""
    row: "Bob", "CTO", "Alice"
    row: "Carol", "CFO", "Alice"
    row: "Dave", "Engineer", "Bob"
    row: "Eve", "Accountant", "Carol"
    row: "Frank", "Engineer", "Bob"
  end
  ```
  1. **Direct Reports:** Write an expression to find all direct reports of "Bob".
  2. **Chain of Command:** For "Dave", write an expression to find their manager.
  3. **All Reports (Challenge):** How would you find all people who report (directly or indirectly) to "Alice"? What makes this hard with just tables?
  4. **Tree Structure:** Sketch (on paper) how you would represent this organization as a tree, where each node contains a name, title, and a list of direct reports.
  5. **Tree Data Definition:** Write a Pyret data definition for an OrgTree, where each node has a name, title, and a list of OrgTree direct reports.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Tables are powerful for flat data, but trees are better for representing and processing hierarchical structures.
- Next time: we’ll define tree data in code and write functions to process them.
