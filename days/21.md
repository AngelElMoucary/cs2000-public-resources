title: Day 21 - Intro to Trees
---

NOTE: this is way too short -- should actually do more work with the table, or get to the tree here.

### 1. Introduction to Trees
- **Overview:**
  - Explain that trees are hierarchical data—data that nest sub-entities within a larger entity.
  - Introduce a real-world scenario: an organization’s hierarchy, where each employee (or manager) has a name, title, and (possibly empty) list of direct reports.
- **Why Tables Fall Short:**
  - A table represents flat rows. While you can include a “manager” field in each row, you lose the nesting of subordinates.
  - Example questions that are hard to answer with a table:
    - “Who are all the subordinates reporting (directly or indirectly) to a given manager?”
    - “What is the depth (number of levels) of the organization?”
- **Do Now:**
  - Ask: “Imagine you have a table with columns: name, title, manager. How would you list the direct reports of a manager? How would you compute the full chain of command?”
  - Brief discussion to surface difficulties (e.g., repeated table scans, inability to naturally express nested structure).

### 2. An Example Organization Table (15 minutes)
- **Present a Table Example:**
  - Show a simplified organization table:
    ```pyret
    org-table = table: name, title, manager
      row: "Alice", "CEO", ""
      row: "Bob", "CTO", "Alice"
      row: "Carol", "CFO", "Alice"
      row: "Dave", "Engineer", "Bob"
      row: "Eve", "Accountant", "Carol"
      row: "Frank", "Engineer", "Bob"
    end
    ```
- **Interactive Discussion:**
  - Ask: “How would you compute, using table functions, the list of direct reports for Bob?”  
  - (Students may suggest filtering rows where manager equals "Bob.")
  - Next, ask: “How would you compute all reports (not just direct) for Bob?”  
  - Emphasize that while it is possible, it becomes clumsy and inefficient when the organization has many levels.
- **Critique:**
  - Summarize the pitfalls:
    - Repeated filtering across generations.
    - Loss of inherent tree structure.
    - Harder to compose recursive operations (e.g., computing organizational depth).

### 3. Conclusion and Reflection (10 minutes)
- **Summary:**
  - Explain that while tables are great for flat data, they make representing and processing hierarchical (tree) data cumbersome.
