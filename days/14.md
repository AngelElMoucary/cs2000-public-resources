## Skills: [3](/skills/#(3))

## Pre-reading: [DRAFT 29.3](https://dbp.io/static/dcic/alternate.html#(part._.Mutable_.Variables_and_.Loops_in_.Pyret))


## Intro (15 min)
- To define our own list processing functions, we need a way to do computations
  for each element in the list. Multiple ways to do that, today we will show
  iteration with `for each()`.
- This requires being able to modify variables, which in Pyret means they must
  be declared with `var`, and must be updated with the special operator `:=`.
- Pattern is:
  ```pyret
  var my-var = initial-value
  for each(my-elt from my-list):
    code
    to
    handle
    my-elt
    and update
    my-var
  end
  my-var # final result
  ```
- Example: while `sum` is built in, we could have defined it ourselves as:
  ```pyret
  fun my-sum(num-list :: List<Number>) -> Number block:
    var total = 0
    for each(n from num-list):
      total := total + n
    end
    total
  where:
    my-sum([list: 0, 1, 2, 3]) is 6
  end
  ``` 

## Class Exercises (40 min)
- Define your own `product` function that takes a list of numbers and returns
  their product (multiply all of them together).
- Define a function `sum-even-numbers` that takes a list of integers and adds up only
  the even numbers -- the rest should be ignored (`num-modulo` may be helpful)!
- Define a function `my-length` that takes a list of any value and returns the number
  of elements in the list.

TODO / FIXME ADD MORE

## Wrap-up (5 min)
- Mutable variables can be declared with `var` and updated with `:=`.
- `for each` can run code for each element of a list; combined with mutable
  variables, this allows writing custom list operations.
