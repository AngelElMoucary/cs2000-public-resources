## Skills: None

## Pre-reading: [5.1.4](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/tables-to-lists.html#(part._.Operating_on_.Lists)) (aside from 5.1.4.1), [5.1.6](https://dcic-world.org/2024-09-03/tables-to-lists.html#%28part._.Combining_.Lists_and_.Tables%29)

## Intro (20 mins)
- Last time we saw operations on lists of numbers from [math](https://pyret.org/docs/latest/math.html) and [statistics](https://pyret.org/docs/latest/statistics.html). Today we are going to dive into many more built in operations on lists that come from [lists](https://pyret.org/docs/latest/lists.html).
- Imagine a list of discount codes used by a magazine:
  ```pyret
  discount-codes = [list: "NEWYEAR", "student", "NONE", "student", "VIP", "none"]
  ```
- Which may have come from a column of a table. As part of data cleaning, one
  thing you might want to do first is figure out what are the distinct codes
  used.
  ```pyret
  import lists as L

  unique-codes = L.distinct(discount-codes)
  ```
- We also have operations on lists that are similar to operations you saw
  previously on tables. For example, we can `L.filter` to remove codes that
  represent no discount (in this case, normalized "none").
  ```pyret
  fun is-real-code(code :: String) -> Boolean:
    not(string-to-lower(code) == "none")
  end

  real-codes = L.filter(is-real-code, unique-codes)
  ```
- Like how tables have `row-n()`, lists have a way of getting an element by position:
    ```pyret
    first-code = real-codes.get(0)
    ```
- For tables, we had a few ways of transforming the existing data -- adding a
  new column with `build-column`, or transforming a single column with
  `transform-column`. Since lists have only a single value, there is only one
  version, called `L.map`.
- We can use this to, e.g., get lowercase versions of each discount code:
  ```pyret
  lower-codes = L.map(string-to-lower, codes-real)
  ```

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Lists have many built-in operations -- we showed a few, but there are more at https://pyret.org/docs/latest/lists.html.
