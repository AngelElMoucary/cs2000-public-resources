## Task Planning, Preparing Data Tables, and Visualizations

**Topic Focus:** How to plan a data analysis task, prepare data tables by creating bins and splitting columns, and visualize data to detect errors and communicate findings.

### 1. Introduction and Warm-Up (10 minutes)
- **Overview:**  
  - Introduce task planning as the process of breaking down a complex data problem into manageable steps.
- **Do Now:**  
  - “Imagine you have a table of weather data. What might you need to do before analyzing trends in temperature?”  
  - Invite a few responses (e.g., bin temperatures, handle missing dates).

### 2. Developing a Task Plan (15 minutes)
- **Example Scenario:**  
  - Use a self-contained table of weather data:
  ```pyret
  weather-data =
    table: date, temperature, precipitation
      row: "2025-01-01", 32, 0.1
      row: "2025-01-02", 45, 0
      row: "2025-01-03", 28, 0.2
      row: "2025-01-04", 55, 0
      row: "2025-01-05", 60, 0
    end
  ```
- **Activity:**  
  - Have students, in small groups, write out a task plan (using bullet points
    or a diagram) for the scenario of visualizing the number of cold, mild, and hot days. 
  - For example:
- **Task Plan Outline:**  
  - **Step 1:** Clean the data (ensure temperatures are numbers, dates are in a consistent format).
  - **Step 2:** Create bins for temperature (e.g., “cold” if below 40, “mild” if between 40 and 60, “hot” if above 60).
  - **Step 3:** Count the number of days in each temperature bin.
  - **Step 4:** Visualize the counts using a bar chart.
- **Share and Discuss:**  
  - Groups share their task plans and compare approaches.

### 3. Preparing Data Tables (20 minutes)
- **Creating Bins:**  
  - Write a function to create a temperature label for each day:
  ```pyret
  fun temp-label(r :: Row) -> String:
    t = r["temperature"]
    if t < 40:
      "cold"
    else if (t > 40) and (t < 60):
      "mild"
    else:
      "hot"
    end
  end
  ```
  - Build a new table column with these labels:
  ```pyret
  weather-with-bin = build-column(weather-data, "temp-bin", temp-label)
  ```
- **Splitting Columns Example:**  
  - Introduce a table of employee names where full names need to be split:
  ```pyret
  employees =
    table: full-name, department
      row: "Jordan Smith", "Sales"
      row: "Alexandra Lee", "Engineering"
      row: "Sam", "Marketing"
    end
  ```
  - Ask: “How would you replace `full-name` with two columns: `first-name` and `last-name`?”  
  - **Task Plan (without full code):**
    - Identify names with spaces.
    - For names with a space, use `string-split(full-name, " ")` to extract first and last names.
    - For names without a space, set `first-name` to the full name and `last-name` to an empty string.
- **Interactive Discussion:**  
  - Ask for volunteers to suggest test strings (e.g., `"Jordan Smith"`, `"Sam"`, `"Maria del Carmen"`).
- **Visualizing Data:**  
  - Demonstrate how a visualization can help verify data preparation.
  - For example, create a frequency bar chart of temperature bins:
  ```pyret
  freq-bar-chart(weather-with-bin, "temp-bin")
  ```
  - Discuss how the plot can reveal if any unexpected bin labels appear (indicating potential errors).

### 4. Wrap-Up and Reflection (5 minutes)
- **Recap:**  
  - Summarize how planning, data preparation (binning and splitting), and visualizations work together in a data analysis.
