## Discovering Recursive Definitions by Example

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Context & Motivation:**
  - Recap that students now know about structured and conditional data, and that lists (built with `[list: ...]`) are a kind of structured data with two parts: a first element and the rest (which is itself a list).
  - Explain that although we’ve computed with lists using for loops, another powerful approach is to process lists recursively.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Understand that every non-empty list has a “first” and a “rest.”
  - Use examples to see a pattern for computing over lists recursively.
- **Do Now:**
  - Ask: “Consider the list `[list: 4, 7, 9]`. What is its first element? What is its rest?”
  - Have students share: First is 4, rest is `[list: 7, 9]`; then note that the rest’s first is 7 and its rest is `[list: 9]`, and so on.

### 2. Using Examples to “Discover” Recursive Functions (25 minutes)
- **Example 1: Computing the Length of a List (`my-len`)**
  - **Step-by-Step Examples:**
    - *Case 1:* `my-len(empty)` is 0.
    - *Case 2:* `my-len([list: 5])` is 1.
    - *Case 3:* `my-len([list: 4, 7, 9])` is 3.
      - Notice: The first element is 4, and the rest is `[list: 7, 9]`, which has length 2.
      - So we can say: `my-len([list: 4, 7, 9])` is `1 + my-len([list: 7, 9])`.
  - **Discussion:**
    - Ask: “How do these examples reveal a pattern?”  
      *Answer:* An empty list has length 0, and a non-empty list’s length is 1 plus the length of its rest.
- **Example 2: Computing the Sum of a List (`my-sum`)**
  - **Step-by-Step Examples:**
    - *Case 1:* `my-sum(empty)` is 0.
    - *Case 2:* `my-sum([list: 4])` is 4.
    - *Case 3:* `my-sum([list: 4, 7, 9])` is 4 + (sum of `[list: 7, 9]`), which is 4 + 16 = 20.
  - **Discussion:**
    - Ask: “What pattern do you see?”  
      *Answer:* For a non-empty list, the sum equals the first element plus the sum of the rest.
- **Example 3: Transforming a List by Doubling Each Element (`my-doubles`)**
  - **Step-by-Step Examples:**
    - *Case 1:* `my-doubles(empty)` is empty.
    - *Case 2:* `my-doubles([list: 3])` is `[list: 6]`.
    - *Case 3:* `my-doubles([list: 3, 5, 2])` is:
      - First element: 3 doubled is 6.
      - The rest: `my-doubles([list: 5, 2])` is `[list: 10, 4]`.
      - So overall: `[list: 6, 10, 4]`.
  - **Activity:**
    - Ask students to write down similar examples for a function that returns the string length for each string in a list (e.g., `my-str-len`).
- **Concluding Discussion:**
  - Emphasize that these examples demonstrate how the answer for a whole list can be expressed in terms of the first element and the answer for the rest.  
  - Explain that this is the key insight that leads to a recursive definition.

### 3. From Examples to Code (15 minutes)
- **Recap of the Pattern:**
  - If the list is empty, return the “base case” value (e.g., 0 for length or sum, empty for transformation functions).
  - If the list is non-empty (using `cases (List) l:`), then bind the first element to a variable (say, `f`) and the rest of the list to another variable (say, `r`), then compute the result using `f` and the recursive call on `r`.
- **Writing the Code for `my-len`:**
  ```pyret
  fun my-len(l :: List<Any>) -> Number:
    cases (List) l:
      | empty => 0
      | link(f, r) => 1 + my-len(r)
    end
  end
  ```
- **Writing the Code for `my-sum`:**
  ```pyret
  fun my-sum(l :: List<Number>) -> Number:
    cases (List) l:
      | empty => 0
      | link(f, r) => f + my-sum(r)
    end
  end
  ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask students: “Using the same idea, how would you write a recursive function that doubles each element (i.e., `my-doubles`)?”
  - Guide them to produce:
    ```pyret
    fun my-doubles(l :: List<Number>) -> List<Number>:
      cases (List) l:
        | empty => empty
        | link(f, r) => link(f * 2, my-doubles(r))
      end
    end
    ```

### 4. Wrap-Up (10 minutes)
- **Summary:**
  - Emphasize that by examining concrete examples (including the empty case and various non-empty cases), we can “discover” a recursive definition.
  - Highlight that lists are structured data: every non-empty list consists of a first element and a rest (which is itself a list).
