# Variables, Mutation, and For Each Loops

## 1. Introduction (5 minutes)

- **Overview:**
  - Explain that that to modify variables, they must be declared with `var`, and must be updated with the special operator `:=`.
  - Today’s focus is on:
    - Declaring and updating variables.
    - Iterating over lists with the `for each(...)` loop.
    - Understanding how variable updates affect the program’s directory (the mapping of names to values).

- **Motivating Example:**
  - We want to compute a running total (sum) over a list of numbers using a loop.

## 2. Variables and Mutation in Pyret (15 minutes)

### 2.1 Declaring and Updating Variables

- **Syntax and Behavior:**
  - A variable is declared with `var` and given an initial value.
  - The update operator `:=` changes the value stored in the variable.
  
- **Example: Sum of a List Using Mutation**

  ```pyret
  var total = 0
  spy: total end
  total := 5
  spy: total end
  ```
  
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask: “What do you expect to see if you execute:
    ```pyret
    var score = 0
    score := score + 10
    score := score * 2
    spy: score end
    ```
    ?”
  - Invite a few responses and then run the code together.

### 2.2 Variable Mutation in Memory

- **Discussion:**
  - Explain the idea of the program’s directory: a mapping from names (like `total`) to values.
  - When we update a variable with `:=`, the directory’s entry for that variable changes.
  
- **Diagram Activity:**
  - Draw a simple diagram on the board showing the variable `total` with its initial value, then how it changes after each update.

- **Do Now:**
  - “Trace the updates for the following code on paper:
    ```pyret
    var x = 10
    x := x + 5
    x := x * 2
    ```
    What is the final value of `x`?”

## 3. For Each Loops in Pyret (25 minutes)

### 3.1 Introduction to `for each`

- **Concept:**
  - Pyret’s `for each` loop is a general iterator that runs a block of code for every element in a list.

- **Syntax Overview:**

  ```pyret
  for each(item from some-list):
    <body using item>
  end
  ```
  
- **Example – Summing a List:**

  ```pyret
  var total = 0
  for each(n from [list: 0, 1, 2, 3]):
    total := total + n
  end
  check:
    total is 6
  end
  ```

  - **Discussion:**  
    - Ask, “What is happening at each iteration? How does `n` change? What is the role of `:=` in updating `total`?”

### 3.2 More Examples Using `for each`

- **Example – Calculating a Product:**

  ```pyret
  var product = 1
  for each(n from range(1,5)):
    product := product * n
  end
  check:
    product is 24
  end
  ```
  
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask students: “Modify the loop to compute the sum of even numbers in the list `[list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.”
  - Expected solution:
    ```pyret
    var even_sum = 0
    for each(n from [list: 1,2,3,4,5,6]):
      when num-modulo(n, 2) == 0:
        even_sum := even_sum + n
      end
    end
    check:
      even_sum is 2 + 4 + 6  // which is 12
    end
    ```

### 3.3 How `for each` Integrates with the Directory

- **Discussion:**
  - Explain that the `for each` loop temporarily introduces a variable (e.g., `n`) that takes on successive elements of the list.
  - Show with a diagram how:
    - Initially, `total` is 0.
    - On the first iteration, `n` is 0, and then `total` is updated.
    - Continue until the loop finishes.
  
- **Do Now:**
  - “Trace the following code on paper and draw the directory after each iteration:
    ```pyret
    var counter = 0
    for each(word from [list: "hello", "world"]):
      counter := counter + 1
    end
    ```
    What is the final value of `counter`?”
    
    Now add a `spy` statement to see the trace as the program runs.
    ```pyret
    var counter = 0
    for each(word from [list: "hello", "world"]):
      spy: word end
      counter := counter + 1
    end
    ```
    
    
  
- **Explain:**
  - The variable `counter` is updated during each iteration. The temporary variable `word` holds each element, but its final value isn’t used outside the loop.

## 4. Wrap-Up and Reflection (5 minutes)

- **Recap Key Points:**
  - Declaring mutable variables using `var` and updating them with `:=`.
  - Using `for each` to iterate over lists while performing side effects.
  - How the directory (the mapping of variable names to values) changes during the execution of a loop.
  
- **Exit Ticket:**
  - Ask each student to write a short summary on paper: “Describe in your own words how a `for each` loop updates a variable during iteration.”
  
- **Final Discussion:**
  - Invite students to share any questions or insights on using `for each` and variable updates.

---

## Optional Challenge (If Time Allows)

- **Challenge Exercise:**
  - Write a program that uses `for each` to compute both the sum and the product of numbers in a list, and then prints both values.
  - Expected structure:
    ```pyret
    var sum = 0
    var prod = 1
    for each(n from [list: 2, 3, 4]):
      sum := sum + n
      prod := prod * n
    end
    ```
