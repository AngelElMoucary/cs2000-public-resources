## Outcomes: [1.1](/outcomes/#(1.1))
 
## From Repeated Code to Custom Functions

### **Lecture Objectives**
- Understand the need to refactor repeated expressions into functions.
- Learn how to write a basic function without type annotations.
- Observe problems that arise without type annotations.
- Introduce and add type annotations to improve error messages and code clarity.
- Practice by creating two functions: one for drawing a "three-tier cake" image and another for computing the cost of custom t-shirts.

---

### **I. Introduction & Motivation (5 minutes)**
- **Overview:**
  Today we will learn how to capture repeated patterns in functions. First, we'll create functions as a simple way to not repeat ourselves, and then we'll see how type annotations can help us catch mistakes early.

---

### **II. Creating Functions Without Type Annotations (20 minutes)**
#### **A. Example 1: Three-Tier Cake Image**
- **Scenario:**
  Suppose we want to draw images of three-tier cakes. Each cake consists of three equally sized rectangular layers, and the only difference is the color (or "flavor") of each layer.

- **Repeated Expressions (Without a Function):**
  ```pyret
  # Cake 1 (Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry)
  frame(
    above(rectangle(120, 30, "solid", "brown"),
      above(rectangle(120, 30, "solid", "white"),
        rectangle(120, 30, "solid", "pink"))))

  # Cake 2 (Lemon, Blueberry, Mint)
  frame(
    above(rectangle(120, 30, "solid", "yellow"),
      above(rectangle(120, 30, "solid", "blue"),
        rectangle(120, 30, "solid", "green"))))
  ```
- **Transition to a Function:**
  Identify the fixed parts (the dimensions, the stacking with `above`, the frame) and the changing parts (the colors). Replace the changing parts with parameters:

- **Basic Function Definition (No Type Annotations Yet):**
  ```pyret
  fun three-tier-cake(top, middle, bottom):
    frame(
      above(rectangle(120, 30, "solid", top),
        above(rectangle(120, 30, "solid", middle),
          rectangle(120, 30, "solid", bottom))))
  end
  ```
- **Live Demo:**
  - Enter the above function definition in the definitions pane.
  - Then write the following in the interactions:
    ```pyret
    three-tier-cake("brown", "white", "pink")
    three-tier-cake("yellow", "blue", "green")
    ```
  - **Discussion:**
    Explain how the function body is reused with different inputs, and show that the output images match the desired cakes.

#### **B. Example 2: T-shirt Cost Calculation**
- **Scenario:**
  Consider a scenario where a t-shirt costs \$5.00 plus an extra \$0.10 per character in a slogan.

- **Repeated Expressions (Without a Function):**
  ```pyret
  # Ordering 4 t-shirts with "Go Team!"
  4 * (5.00 + (string-length("Go Team!") * 0.10))

  # Ordering 7 t-shirts with "Hello World"
  7 * (5.00 + (string-length("Hello World") * 0.10))
  ```
- **Transition to a Function:**
  Here, the fixed part is the pricing structure (base price and per-character fee) while the number of shirts and the slogan are the parameters.

- **Basic Function Definition:**
  ```pyret
  fun tshirt-cost(num-shirts, slogan):
    num-shirts * (5.00 + (string-length(slogan) * 0.10))
  end
  ```
- **Live Demo:**
  - Add this function definition to the definitions pane.
  - Then, in the interactions pane, try:
    ```pyret
    tshirt-cost(4, "Go Team!")
    tshirt-cost(7, "Hello World")
    tshirt-cost(0, "Any Slogan")
    tshirt-cost(5, "")
    ```
- **Discussion:**
  Emphasize how the function generalizes the pricing logic so you can easily compute different orders without retyping the calculation each time.

---

### **III. Motivating and Adding Type Annotations (15 minutes)**
#### **A. Observing Potential Issues**
- **Error Scenario:**
  Ask: "What might happen if we accidentally call `three-tier-cake` with a non-string value?"
  For example:
  ```pyret
  three-tier-cake(123, "white", "pink")
  ```
- **Discussion:** Without type annotations, the error messages refer to
  lower-level operations (e.g., `rectangle(120, 30, "solid", 123)`), which can
  be confusing. It is also harder for someone who reads the code to know what it
  should do! This motivates the need for type annotations to not only catch
  errors earlier, but to express the programmers **intent** -- this is our first
  encounter with the idea of **design** -- while programs without type
  annotations will potentially work, programs with annotations will be clearer /
  easier to understand, easier to modify, and even easier to write in the first place!

#### **B. Revising the Functions with Type Annotations**
- **Enhanced Three-Tier Cake Function:**
  ```pyret
  fun three-tier-cake(top :: String,
      middle :: String,
      bottom :: String) -> Image:
   frame(
      above(rectangle(120, 30, "solid", top),
        above(rectangle(120, 30, "solid", middle),
          rectangle(120, 30, "solid", bottom))))
  end
  ```
  - **Live Demo:**
    Replace the earlier definition with this annotated version and then re-run the correct calls.

- **Enhanced T-shirt Cost Function:**
  ```pyret
  fun tshirt-cost(num-shirts :: Number, slogan :: String) -> Number:
    num-shirts * (5.00 + (string-length(slogan) * 0.10))
  end
  ```
  - **Live Demo:**
    Update the t-shirt function definition in the definitions pane. Then, intentionally call:
    ```pyret
    tshirt-cost("four", "Go Team!")
    ```
    Ask: "What does the error message now tell us?"
    How did this differ from the error that occurred without the annotation?

#### **C. Benefits of Type Annotations**
- **Key Points:**
  - Type annotations serve as a form of documentation to explain what kind of input each parameter expects.
  - They help Pyret catch mistakes early, producing more user-friendly error messages.
  - They guide both the programmer and anyone else reading the code to understand how the function should be used.

### **IV. Recap and Q&A (10 minutes)**
- **Recap Key Points:**
  - **Step 1:** We started with repeated expressions (cake layers and t-shirt cost) and refactored them into functions.
  - **Step 2:** We first defined functions without type annotations to focus on structure and reuse.
  - **Step 3:** We then saw potential pitfalls (such as passing a wrong data type) and added type annotations to clarify expectations and improve error messages.
- **Questions for Discussion:**
  - "How do type annotations help prevent bugs in our functions?"
  - "Can you think of other benefits of documenting a function's input and output types?"

- **Final Reflective Exercise (Do Now):**
  Ask students to write down a function idea that they could use in a project (for example, a function that calculates the area of different shapes). Have them outline the fixed and variable parts and consider what types each parameter should have.

---

### **V. Conclusion (5 minutes)**
- **Summary:**
  - We learned how to encapsulate repeated code into functions.
  - We first wrote functions without type annotations to grasp the core idea.
  - We then introduced type annotations to catch errors and document our code.
