## Decisions and Booleans—From Parking Fees to Driving Eligibility

### **Lecture Objectives**
- Understand why and how to use conditionals (if expressions) in programs.
- Learn about booleans and how to combine them with operators like **and**, **or**, and **not**.
- See how conditionals allow computations to "decide" between different outcomes.
- Practice writing functions that use conditionals and combine functions together.
- Explore nested conditionals and the idea of local (private) variables within functions.

---

### **I. Introduction and Motivation (5 minutes)**
- **Discussion Starter:**
  Ask: "Have you ever parked your car in a lot where the fee depends on how long you stayed? How would you describe the pricing rule?"
  (Allow a few responses—expect answers like "a flat fee for short stays, a higher fee for longer stays.")

- **Context:**
  Explain that many real-world pricing models require decisions: for example, a parking garage might charge different fees depending on the number of hours parked. Today, we'll write functions that decide the fee based on input and then explore booleans and conditionals.

---

### **II. Motivating Example: Calculating Parking Fees (10 minutes)**
#### **A. Scenario Description**
- **Example Scenario:**
  A parking garage charges:
  - **\$3** if you park for **2 hours or less**,
  - **\$5** if you park for **more than 2 hours but no more than 5 hours**,
  - **\$8** if you park for **more than 5 hours**.

#### **B. Exploring Examples (Do Now)**
- Ask students:
  - "What fee would you expect if you park for 2 hours? What about 2.01 hours, 5 hours, and 5.5 hours?"
  Encourage them to identify the boundary values.

- **Proposed Examples (using Pyret's `where` notation later):**
  - `calc-parking-fee(2) is 3`
  - `calc-parking-fee(2.01) is 5`
  - `calc-parking-fee(5) is 5`
  - `calc-parking-fee(5.5) is 8`

#### **C. Writing a Basic Function with a Conditional**
- **Explain the if-expression syntax:**
  - "An if-expression asks a question that produces either true or false and then chooses one of two answers."

- **Write the Function (code shown on screen):**
  ```pyret
  fun calc-parking-fee(hours :: Number) -> Number:
    doc: "Calculate parking fee: $3 if hours <= 2, $5 if hours <= 5, otherwise $8."
    if hours <= 2:
      3
    else if hours <= 5:
      5
    else:
      8
    end
  end
  ```
- **Live Demo:**
  - Run the function and then test:
    ```pyret
    calc-parking-fee(2)      # Expected: 3
    calc-parking-fee(2.01)   # Expected: 5
    calc-parking-fee(5)      # Expected: 5
    calc-parking-fee(5.5)    # Expected: 8
    ```
- **Discussion:**
  Point out how the if-expression checks conditions in order and returns the first true branch.

---

### **III. Introduction to Booleans (10 minutes)**
#### **A. What Are Booleans?**
- **Definition:**
  Booleans are the values `true` and `false`. They result from comparisons and logical tests.

- **Simple Examples (Do Now):**
  - Ask students to type:
    ```pyret
    1 < 2    # Should produce true
    5 == 5   # Should produce true
    5 == 4   # Should produce false
    ```

#### **B. Other Boolean Operations**
- **Comparisons and Equality:**
  Explain that in addition to `<` and `==`, we also have operators like `>=` or type-specific ones (e.g., `string-equal`).
- **Combining Booleans:**
  Introduce:
  - **and:** `(1 < 2) and (3 < 4)` yields `true`
  - **or:** `(1 < 2) or (5 < 3)` yields `true`
  - **not:** `not(1 < 2)` yields `false`

- **Interactive Exercise:**
  Ask:
  - "What do you think `(2 < 1) or (4 == 4)` evaluates to?"
  - "How about `not(2 < 1)`?"

- **Discussion:**
  Emphasize that booleans let us express yes/no, true/false decisions, which are the heart of conditionals.

---

### **IV. Asking Multiple Questions and Combining Conditions (10 minutes)**
#### **A. Refining Our Parking Fee with Explicit "Between" Conditions**
- **Motivation:**
  Although our earlier `calc-parking-fee` works, we can be more explicit with combined conditions.

- **Rewrite the Middle Case:**
  ```pyret
  fun calc-parking-fee2(hours :: Number) -> Number:
    doc: "Calculate fee with explicit between: $3 if hours <= 2, $5 if (hours > 2) and (hours <= 5), else $8."
    if hours <= 2:
      3
    else if (hours > 2) and (hours <= 5):
      5
    else:
      8
    end
  end
  ```
- **Live Demo:**
  Test the function with various inputs.

- **Discussion:**
  Ask: "Why do we include parentheses in the boolean expression? What might happen if we left them off?"
  (Guide students to understand operator precedence and clarity.)

#### **B. New Example: Determining Driving Eligibility**
- **Scenario:**
  Write a function that determines if a person can drive. The rules are: a person can drive if they are **16 or older** and they **have a license**.

- **Function Definition:**
  ```pyret
  fun can-drive(age :: Number, has-license :: Boolean) -> Boolean:
    doc: "Return true if age is at least 16 and the person has a driver's license."
    age >= 16 and has-license
  end
  ```
- **Interactive Demo:**
  Evaluate:
  ```pyret
  can-drive(15, true)   # Expected: false
  can-drive(16, false)  # Expected: false
  can-drive(18, true)   # Expected: true
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  Highlight how combining booleans (with **and**) gives us the decision.

---

### **V. Evaluating Expressions by Reduction (5 minutes)**
- **Walk Through a Step-by-Step Reduction:**
  Use `calc-parking-fee(6)` as an example.
  - Start with:
    ```pyret
    if 6 <= 2: 3 else if 6 <= 5: 5 else: 8 end
    ```
  - Explain that since `6 <= 2` is false, we check the next condition.
  - Since `6 <= 5` is also false, we move to the else branch, yielding **8**.

- **Discussion:**
  Emphasize that understanding these steps can help debug programs.

---

### **VI. Composing Functions (5 minutes)**
#### **A. Combining Functions in a Computation**
- **Scenario:**
  Now imagine the parking garage adds a 10% sales tax to the fee. We can write a separate function:

- **Define a Tax Function:**
  ```pyret
  fun add-tax(fee :: Number) -> Number:
    doc: "Apply a 10% sales tax to the fee."
    fee * 1.10
  end
  ```
- **Compose the Functions:**
  - Write an expression that computes the total cost:
    ```pyret
    add-tax(calc-parking-fee(6))
    ```
- **Live Demo:**
  Evaluate the composition and show that it first computes the fee (8) then applies tax (8 * 1.10 = 8.8).

#### **B. Discussing Evaluation:**
- Compare two styles:
  - One that names the intermediate result:
    ```pyret
    fee = calc-parking-fee(6)
    add-tax(fee)
    ```
  - And one that nests the calls.
- Ask: "Which style do you find clearer and why?"

---

### **VII. Nested Conditionals and Local Variables (5 minutes)**
#### **A. Scenario: Parking Fee with a VIP Discount**
- **New Rule:**
  VIP members receive a \$1 discount on the fee, but the fee cannot go below \$2.

- **Define the Function Using Nested Conditionals:**
  ```pyret
  fun calc-parking-total(hours :: Number, is-vip :: Boolean) -> Number:
    doc: "Calculate parking fee and apply a $1 VIP discount, but ensure a minimum fee of $2."
    base = calc-parking-fee(hours)
    if is-vip:
      if base - 1 < 2:
        2
      else:
        base - 1
      end
    else:
      base
    end
  end
  ```
- **Live Demo:**
  Test with:
  ```pyret
  calc-parking-total(1.5, true)   # Fee should be max(3-1,2) = 2 (minimum)
  calc-parking-total(3, true)     # Fee should be 5-1 = 4
  calc-parking-total(6, false)    # Fee should be 8 (no discount)
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  Explain that the inner `if` is nested inside the outer one and that the local variable `base` is defined only inside the function. Emphasize that names defined within a function (like `base`) are not accessible outside.

---

### **VIII. Recap and Q&A (5 minutes)**
- **Key Points Recap:**
  - **Conditionals:**
    How `if`, `else if`, and `else` let your program decide between different outcomes.
  - **Booleans:**
    The special values `true` and `false` and how to combine them using **and**, **or**, and **not**.
  - **Multiple Conditions:**
    Using combined boolean expressions (with parentheses) to capture "between" conditions.
  - **Nested Conditionals:**
    Writing an `if` inside an `if` to handle more complex decisions.
  - **Function Composition:**
    Combining functions (e.g., computing a fee then applying tax) and the role of local variables in a function's directory.

- **Questions for Discussion:**
  - "How does the order of conditions in an if-expression affect the result?"
  - "What advantages do nested conditionals offer when handling more complex decision logic?"
  - "When might you prefer to use intermediate variables (like `base`) rather than composing functions directly?"

- **Final Do Now:**
  Ask students to briefly write (or discuss) a scenario from their own experience where a decision must be made based on multiple conditions. How would they model that using conditionals and booleans?

---

### **IX. Conclusion (Optional Extra 1-2 minutes)**
- **Wrap Up:**
  Summarize that conditionals and booleans allow programs to "choose" different paths based on data, making our code flexible and responsive to different inputs.
