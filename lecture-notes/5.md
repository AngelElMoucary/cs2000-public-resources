## [Outcomes](../outcomes/): 1.1, 2.1, 3.1


## Decisions and Booleansâ€”From Parking Fees to Driving Eligibility

### **Lecture Objectives**
- Understand why and how to use conditionals (if expressions) in programs.
- Learn about booleans and how to combine them with operators like **and**, **or**, and **not**.
- See how conditionals allow computations to "decide" between different outcomes.
- Practice writing functions that use conditionals and combine functions together.
- Explore nested conditionals and the idea of local (private) variables within functions.

---

### **I. Introduction and Motivation (5 minutes)**
- **Context:**
  Explain that many real-world pricing models require decisions: for example, a parking garage might charge different fees depending on the number of hours parked. Today, we'll write functions that decide the fee based on input and then explore booleans and conditionals.

---

### **II. Motivating Example: Calculating Parking Fees (10 minutes)**
#### **A. Scenario Description**
- **Example Scenario:**
  A parking garage charges:
  - **\$3** if you park for **2 hours or less**,
  - **\$5** if you park for **more than 2 hours but no more than 5 hours**,
  - **\$8** if you park for **more than 5 hours**.

#### **B. Exploring Examples (Do Now)**
- Ask students:
  - "What fee would you expect if you park for 2 hours? What about 2.01 hours, 5 hours, and 5.5 hours?"
  Encourage them to identify the boundary values.

- **Proposed Examples (using Pyret's `where` notation later):**
  - `calc-parking-fee(2) is 3`
  - `calc-parking-fee(2.01) is 5`
  - `calc-parking-fee(5) is 5`
  - `calc-parking-fee(5.5) is 8`

### **III. Introduction to Booleans (10 minutes)**
#### **A. What Are Booleans?**
- **Definition:**
  Booleans are the values `true` and `false`. They result from comparisons and logical tests.

- **Simple Examples (Do Now):**
  - Ask students to type:
    ```pyret
    1 < 2    # Should produce true
    5 == 5   # Should produce true
    5 == 4   # Should produce false
    ```

#### **B. Other Boolean Operations**
- **Comparisons and Equality:**
  Explain that in addition to `<` and `==`, we also have operators like `>=` or type-specific ones (e.g., `string-equal`).
- **Combining Booleans:**
  Introduce:
  - **and:** `(1 < 2) and (3 < 4)` yields `true`
  - **or:** `(1 < 2) or (5 < 3)` yields `true`
  - **not:** `not(1 < 2)` yields `false`

- **Interactive Exercise:**
  Ask:
  - "What do you think `(2 < 1) or (4 == 4)` evaluates to?"
  - "How about `not(2 < 1)`?"

- **Discussion:**
  Emphasize that booleans let us express yes/no, true/false decisions, which are the heart of conditionals.

---

#### **IV. Writing a Basic Function with a Conditional**
- **Explain the if-expression syntax:**
  - An if-expression asks questions that produce booleans and then chooses corresponding answers. With more than two options, the middle are captured by `else if`. These questions are run in order, and the answer that corresponds to the first `true` is returned.

- **Write the Function (code shown on screen):**
  ```pyret
  fun calc-parking-fee(hours :: Number) -> Number:
    doc: "Calculate parking fee: $3 if hours <= 2, $5 if hours <= 5, otherwise $8."
    if hours <= 2:
      3
    else if hours <= 5:
      5
    else:
      8
    end
  end
  ```

- **Doc strings**: This introduces a new feature of functions: documentation
  strings! All functions should have concise descriptions of how they work. For
  very simple functions, these may be similar to the function implementation,
  but as functions become more complex, these doc strings are invaluable for
  understanding how to **use** the code, rather than how it **works**.

- **Live Demo:**
  - Run the function and then test:
    ```pyret
    calc-parking-fee(2)      # Expected: 3
    calc-parking-fee(2.01)   # Expected: 5
    calc-parking-fee(5)      # Expected: 5
    calc-parking-fee(5.5)    # Expected: 8
    ```
- **Discussion:**
  Point out how the if-expression checks conditions in order and returns the first true branch.


### **V. Asking Multiple Questions and Combining Conditions (10 minutes)**
#### **A. Refining Our Parking Fee with Explicit "Between" Conditions**
- **Motivation:**
  Although our earlier `calc-parking-fee` works, we can be more explicit with combined conditions.

- **Rewrite the Middle Case:**
  ```pyret
  fun calc-parking-fee2(hours :: Number) -> Number:
    doc: "Calculate parking fee: $3 if hours <= 2, $5 if hours <= 5, otherwise $8."
    if hours <= 2:
      3
    else if (hours > 2) and (hours <= 5):
      5
    else:
      8
    end
  end
  ```
  
- **Live Demo:**
  Test the function with various inputs.

- **Discussion:**
  - Note that our doc string didn't change, as the behavior is the same. 
  - Questions: 
    - Why might we want to write it this way, rather than as we did before? 
    - Why do we include parentheses in the boolean expression? What might happen if we left them off?

#### **B. New Example: Determining Driving Eligibility**
- **Scenario:**
  Write a function that determines if a person can drive. Let's say the rules are: a person can drive if they are **16 or older** and they **have a license**.

- **Function Definition:**
  ```pyret
  fun can-drive(age :: Number, has-license :: Boolean) -> Boolean:
    doc: "Return true if age is at least 16 and the person has a driver's license."
    age >= 16 and has-license
  end
  ```
- **Interactive Demo:**
  Evaluate:
  ```pyret
  can-drive(15, true)   # Expected: false
  can-drive(16, false)  # Expected: false
  can-drive(18, true)   # Expected: true
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  While `and` combined these two booleans together, do we actually need both of these tests?
  

---

### **VI. Evaluating Expressions by Reduction (5 minutes)**
- **Walk Through a Step-by-Step Reduction:**
  Use `calc-parking-fee(6)` as an example.
  - Start with:
    ```pyret
    if 6 <= 2: 
      3 
    else if 6 <= 5: 
      5 
    else: 
      8 
    end
    ```
  - Explain that since `6 <= 2` is false, we check the next condition.
  - Since `6 <= 5` is also false, we move to the else branch, yielding **8**.

- **Discussion:**
  Emphasize that understanding these steps can help debug programs.

---

### **VII. Composing Functions (5 minutes)**
#### **A. Combining Functions in a Computation**
- **Scenario:**
  Now imagine the parking garage adds a 10% sales tax to the fee. We can write a separate function:

- **Define a Tax Function:**
  ```pyret
  fun add-tax(fee :: Number) -> Number:
    doc: "Apply a 10% sales tax to the fee."
    fee * 1.10
  end
  ```
- **Compose the Functions:**
  - Write an expression that computes the total cost:
    ```pyret
    add-tax(calc-parking-fee(6))
    ```
- **Live Demo:**
  Evaluate the composition and show that it first computes the fee (8) then applies tax (8 * 1.10 = 8.8).

#### **B. Discussing Evaluation:**
- Compare two styles:
  - One that names the intermediate result:
    ```pyret
    fee = calc-parking-fee(6)
    add-tax(fee)
    ```
  - And one that nests the calls.
- Ask: "Which style do you find clearer and why?"

### **VIII. Nested Conditionals and Local Variables (5 minutes)**
#### **A. Scenario: Parking Fee with a VIP Discount**
- **New Rule:**
  VIP members receive a \$1 discount on the fee, but the fee cannot go below \$2.

- **Define the Function Using Nested Conditionals:**
  ```pyret
  fun calc-parking-total(hours :: Number, is-vip :: Boolean) -> Number:
    doc: "Calculate parking fee and apply a $1 VIP discount, but ensure a minimum fee of $2."
    base = calc-parking-fee(hours)
    if is-vip:
      if base - 1 < 2:
        2
      else:
        base - 1
      end
    else:
      base
    end
  end
  ```
- **Live Demo:**
  Test with:
  ```pyret
  calc-parking-total(1.5, true)   # Fee should be max(3-1,2) = 2 (minimum)
  calc-parking-total(3, true)     # Fee should be 5-1 = 4
  calc-parking-total(6, false)    # Fee should be 8 (no discount)
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  Explain that the inner `if` is nested inside the outer one and that the local variable `base` is defined only inside the function. Emphasize that names defined within a function (like `base`) are not accessible outside.

---

### **VIII. Recap and Q&A (5 minutes)**
- **Key Points Recap:**
  - **Conditionals:**
    How `if`, `else if`, and `else` let your program decide between different outcomes.
  - **Booleans:**
    Exactly two values `true` and `false` and how to combine them using **and**, **or**, and **not**.
  - **Multiple Conditions:**
    Using combined boolean expressions (with parentheses) to capture "between" conditions.
  - **Nested Conditionals:**
    Writing an `if` inside an `if` to handle more complex decisions.
  - **Function Composition:**
    Combining functions (e.g., computing a fee then applying tax) and the role of local variables in a function's directory.

- **Questions for Discussion:**
  - "How does the order of conditions in an if-expression affect the result?"
  - "What advantages do nested conditionals offer when handling more complex decision logic?"
  - "When might you prefer to use intermediate variables (like `base`) rather than composing functions directly?"

- **Final Do Now:**
  Ask students to briefly write (or discuss) a scenario from their own experience where a decision must be made based on multiple conditions. How would they model that using conditionals and booleans?

---

### **IX. Conclusion (Optional Extra 1-2 minutes)**
- **Wrap Up:**
  Summarize that conditionals and booleans allow programs to "choose" different paths based on data, making our code flexible and responsive to different inputs.
