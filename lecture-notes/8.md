## Adding New Columns and Calculating New Column Values

### 1. Recap and Context Setting (10 minutes)
- **Brief Review:**  
  - Summarize key ideas from previous lectures: creating tables, extracting rows, filtering, and ordering.
- **Context Setting:**  
  - Explain that in many applications we need to enrich our data by computing new values (e.g., calculating bonuses, taxes, or discounts).

### 2. Adding New Columns with Computed Values (20 minutes)
- **Motivation:**  
  - Consider if we wanted to compute employee bonuses.
- **Example: Employee Bonus Calculation**
  - Present a sample table:
    ```pyret
    employees = table: name, base-salary, score
      row: "Sam", 50000, 85
      row: "Lee", 60000, 92
      row: "Alex", 55000, 78
      row: "Jordan", 65000, 88
    end
    ```
- **Helper Function:**  
  - Walk through writing a function to compute bonus (e.g., 5% bonus if score > 80):
    ```pyret
    fun compute-bonus(r :: Row) -> Number:
      if r["score"] > 80:
        r["base-salary"] * 0.05
      else:
        0
      end
    end
    ```
- **Using `build-column`:**  
  - Explain how to add a new column using `build-column`:
    ```pyret
    employees-with-bonus = build-column(employees, "bonus", compute-bonus)
    ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**  
  - Ask students to predict the bonus for each employee.
  - Have them run similar code in groups (or on a shared screen) to verify results.
- **Discussion:**  
  - How does adding a column differ from simply computing a value on an individual row?  
  - Why is it useful to have computed columns in data analysis?

### 3. Updating Existing Columns: Calculating New Column Values (15 minutes)
- **Scenario:**  
  - Introduce a discount scenario with a products table:
    ```pyret
    products = table: product, price
      row: "Notebook", 15.00
      row: "Backpack", 25.00
      row: "Pen", 2.50
      row: "Calculator", 18.00
    end
    ```
- **Transformation Function:**  
  - Write a function to apply a discount (10% off if price < 20):
    ```pyret
    fun apply-discount(price :: Number) -> Number:
      if price < 20:
        price * 0.9
      else:
        price
      end
    end
    ```
- **Using `transform-column`:**  
  - Update the table with the discounted prices:
    ```pyret
    discountedProducts = transform-column(products, "price", apply-discount)
    ```
- **Class Discussion:**  
  - Ask: "After applying the discount, what is the new price of the Calculator? Why might we want to create a new table rather than altering the original?"
- **Hands-On Challenge:**  
  - Propose a new exercise:  
    - Have students write a function to compute a sales tax column (e.g., 8% of the price) and add it to the products table using `build-column`.

### 4. Wrap-Up, Reflection, and Q&A (5 minutes)
- **Recap Key Takeaways:**  
  - How to add a new column using computed values.
  - How to update an existing column.
  - The benefits of immutability: creating new tables rather than modifying in place.
