# Pitfalls of Global Variables

## 1. Introduction (10 minutes)

### A. Global Variables and Mutable State

- **Definition:**
  - Global variables are defined at the top level and can be accessed or modified by multiple functions.
- **Problems for Testing:**
  - They create hidden dependencies between functions.
  - Tests may pass or fail based on the order in which functions are called.
  - They reduce "referential transparency" (functions, given same input, may no
    longer produce same output), making it hard to test functions in isolation,
    hard to understand function behavior.

### B. Learning Goals

- Understand how global mutable state can interfere with testing.
- See concrete Pyret examples showing these issues.
- Discuss best practices for isolating function behavior.

## 2. Demonstration: Global Variables and Testing Difficulties (25 minutes)

### A. Example Scenario: A Global Counter

- **Setup:**
  - We define a global variable `global-counter` that is updated by different functions.

- **Pyret Code Example:**

  ```pyret
  # Global variable declaration
  var global-counter = 0

  # Function that increments the counter by a given value
  fun increment-counter(x :: Number) -> Number block:
    global-counter := global-counter + x
    global-counter
  end

  # Function that resets the counter to 0
  fun reset-counter() -> Nothing:
    global-counter := 0
  end
  ```

### B. Testing Without Isolation

- **Test Case Example:**

  ```pyret
  # Test Block 1: Reset state before testing
  check:
    reset-counter()
    increment-counter(5) is 5
    increment-counter(3) is 8
  end

  # Test Block 2: No reset between tests
  check:
    # No call to reset-counter here!
    increment-counter(2) is ?  # What should the result be?
  end
  ```

- **Discussion:**
  - Ask: “If Test Block 1 runs first, what will the result in Block 2 be? What if Block 2 runs in isolation?”
  - **Key Point:**
    - Since `global-counter` is shared, Block 2’s outcome depends on whether the counter was reset. Tests become order‑dependent and non‑repeatable.

### C. Real-World Consequences

- **Side Effects and Hidden Dependencies:**
  - Functions that rely on global variables cause side effects that “leak” between tests.
  - Example: A logging function that appends to a global log makes it hard to test without first clearing the log.
  - Harder to test is also harder to debug, harder to understand!
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask students: “Predict the value of `global-counter` after the following sequence:
    ```pyret
    reset-counter()
    increment-counter(4)  # Expected: 4
    increment-counter(6)  # Expected: 10
    # Then later call increment-counter(2) without a reset.
    ```
    What is the final value?”
  - Discuss the potential for intermittent test failures when state is not controlled.

## 3. Discussion and Best Practices (15 minutes)

### A. Pure Functions Are Easier to Test

- **Referential Transparency:**
  - A pure function’s output depends only on its inputs, making it predictable and easy to test.
- **Example Contrast:**

  ```pyret
  # Impure function with global state
  fun increment-counter(x :: Number) -> Number block:
    global-counter := global-counter + x
    global-counter
  end

  # Pure function version
  fun pure-increment(total :: Number, x :: Number) -> Number:
    total + x
  end
  ```

- Testing `pure-increment` is straightforward because it has no side effects.

### B. Strategies to Avoid Global State

- **Pass Variables as Parameters:**
  - Instead of using a global variable, pass the current state as a parameter.
- **Localize Mutable State:**
  - Use local accumulators within functions (e.g., within loops) so that state does not leak.
- **Isolate Side Effects:**
  - If side effects are necessary, confine them to a small portion of your code and reset state between tests.

### C. Group Discussion

- **Interactive Question:**
  - “How would you rewrite our counter example so that each test can run in isolation without depending on a global variable?”
  - Encourage students to share ideas (e.g., using pure functions or passing the counter as a parameter).

## 4. Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

- Global mutable state (global variables) can interfere with testing by introducing hidden dependencies.
- Tests may behave unpredictably if global state isn’t reset between function calls.
- Pure functions—those that depend only on their inputs—are much easier to test and reason about.
- Emphasize that designing code to minimize or isolate side effects leads to more maintainable and testable software.
