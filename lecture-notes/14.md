## Lambda Functions and Combining Lists and Tables

**Focus:** Introduce anonymous functions (lambda) and show how to combine list and table operations to solve analysis problems with new examples.

### 1. Introduction & Warm-Up (10 minutes)
- **Recap:**
  - Brief review of list operations and the idea of transforming data.
- **Do Now:**
  - “Given a list of email addresses, how would you extract the username (the part before the '@')? Write down your thoughts.”
- **Discussion:**
  - Share a couple of ideas without full code yet.

### 2. Lambda: Anonymous Functions (15 minutes)
- **Motivating Example – Extracting Usernames:**
  - We want to convert a list of emails to a list of usernames.
- **New Example List:**
  ```pyret
  emails = [list: "alice@cafe.com", "bob@domain.org", "charlie@cafe.com"]
  ```
- **Using a Named Helper Function (Review):**
  ```pyret
  fun extract-username(email :: String) -> String:
    string-split(email, "@").get(0)
  end

  usernames = L.map(extract-username, emails)
  ```
- **Introducing Lambda:**
  - Replace the helper with an anonymous function:
    ```pyret
    usernames = L.map(lam(email): string-split(email, "@").get(0) end, emails)
    ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask: “What would be the output of the lambda version? Write it down.”
  - Discuss and verify.
- **Discussion:**
  - Benefits of using lambda for simple, one‑off functions.

### 3. Combining Lists and Tables (20 minutes)
- **Scenario:**
  A local bookstore tracks sales in a table. You want to compute statistics based on the genres of books sold.
- **Example Table:**
  ```pyret
  book-sales =
    table: title, genre, copies-sold, price
      row: "Mystery at Midnight", "Mystery", 20, 12.99
      row: "Space Adventures", "Sci-Fi", 15, 15.50
      row: "The Last Detective", "Mystery", 25, 11.50
      row: "Future World", "Sci-Fi", 10, 18.00
      row: "Romance in Paris", "Romance", 30, 9.99
    end
  ```
- **Task 1: Extract a List of Copies Sold for a Specific Genre**
  - **Plan:**
    1. Filter the table for rows where genre is, say, "Mystery".
    2. Extract the "copies-sold" column.
  - **Implementation:**
    ```pyret
    fun is-mystery(r :: Row) -> Boolean:
      r["genre"] == "Mystery"
    end

    mystery-sales = filter-with(book-sales, is-mystery)
    copies = mystery-sales.get-column("copies-sold")
    avg-mystery = S.mean(copies)
    ```
  - **Interactive Do Now:**
    - “How many mystery books were sold on average?” (Students compute `avg-mystery`.)
- **Task 2: Combining List Functions with Tables – Analyzing Email Domains**
  - Suppose the bookstore has a customer table:
    ```pyret
    customers =
      table: name, email
        row: "Alice", "alice@reader.com"
        row: "Bob", "bob@novel.org"
        row: "Charlie", "charlie@reader.com"
        row: "Dana", "dana@books.net"
      end
    ```
  - **Plan:**
    1. Extract the email column.
    2. Use `L.map` and `string-split` to get domain names (the part after '@').
    3. Find the distinct domains.
  - **Implementation:**
    ```pyret
    import lists as L
    email-list = customers.get-column("email")
    domains = L.map(lam(email): string-split(email, "@").get(1) end, email-list)
    unique-domains = L.distinct(domains)
    ```
  - **Interactive Discussion:**
    - “Which domain appears most frequently? How might you count the frequency?”
    - Suggest using `L.filter` or comparing lengths.
- **Do Now (Group Activity):**
  - TODO: PROVIDE A BIGGER TABLE FOR THESE
  - Propose multiple task plans for the question: “How many customers with a '.com' email bought more than 10 copies of a book?”
  - Groups discuss different approaches (filtering the table first versus extracting and then filtering a list) and share their plans.

### 4. Wrap-Up & Reflection (5 minutes)
- **Recap Key Points:**
  - Lambda (anonymous functions) let you succinctly express functions, which can
    be useful when using functions like `L.map`, etc.
  - Combining list and table operations enables flexible data analysis.
