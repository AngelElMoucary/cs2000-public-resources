## Computing New Columns and Basic Statistics in Pandas

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Overview:**
  - Recap our restaurant orders DataFrame from the previous lecture.
  - Today we extend it by computing new columns and aggregating data to derive insights.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Learn how to create new columns using operator lifting.
  - Understand how to use boolean masks for conditional updates.
  - Perform basic aggregation with groupby.

### 2. Computing New Columns (20 minutes)
- **Adding a Total Price Column:**
  - Assume each dish has a fixed price given in a separate dictionary.
  - **Example Code:**
    ```python
    # Price list for dishes
    prices = {'Pasta': 12.0, 'Salad': 8.0, 'Burger': 10.0, 'Steak': 20.0}

    # Create a new column 'total_price'
    orders['total_price'] = orders.apply(lambda row: row['quantity'] * prices.get(row['dish'], 0), axis=1)
    print(orders[['dish', 'quantity', 'total_price']])
    ```
- **Updating Columns Conditionally:**
  - Suppose we want to apply a 10% discount to takeout orders.
  - **Example Code:**
    ```python
    discount_mask = orders['order_type'] == 'takeout'
    orders.loc[discount_mask, 'total_price'] = orders.loc[discount_mask, 'total_price'] * 0.90
    print(orders[['order_type', 'total_price']])
    ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask: “How would you create a column that flags orders as 'high' if quantity ≥ 3, otherwise 'low'?”
  - Have students work in pairs to write a solution using a lambda function and `apply`.

### 3. Aggregating and Grouping Data (20 minutes)
- **Aggregating Overall Totals:**
  - Compute the total quantity of dishes sold.
    ```python
    total_quantity = orders['quantity'].sum()
    print("Total dishes sold:", total_quantity)
    ```
- **GroupBy Operations:**
  - **Example 1:** Total sales per dish.
    ```python
    sales_per_dish = orders.groupby('dish')['total_price'].sum()
    print(sales_per_dish)
    ```
  - **Example 2:** Average quantity per order type.
    ```python
    avg_quantity_by_type = orders.groupby('order_type')['quantity'].mean()
    print(avg_quantity_by_type)
    ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Explain that groupby creates a grouped object on which aggregation functions (sum, mean, etc.) can be applied.
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - “How many orders (rows) were made for each order type?” (Use `count()` aggregation.)
  - “What is the overall average total_price across orders?”

### 4. Wrap-Up (5 minutes)
- **Recap:**
  - We computed new columns (e.g., total_price) using apply and lambda functions.
  - We applied conditional updates using masks and .loc.
  - We performed aggregations with groupby to derive totals and averages.
