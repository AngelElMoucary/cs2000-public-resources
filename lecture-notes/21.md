## The Recursive Template for Lists

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Overview:**
  - Recap the previous lecture’s discovery process.
  - Explain that many recursive functions over lists follow a common template.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Understand the general structure of recursive functions that process lists.
  - Learn the “cases” template for pattern matching on lists.
- **Do Now:**
  - Ask: “Recall that every non-empty list has a ‘first’ and a ‘rest.’ Why does that naturally suggest a recursive solution?”

### 2. The General Template for Recursive List Functions (20 minutes)
- **Present the Template:**
  - Write on the board or display:
    ```pyret
    fun function-name(l :: List<T>) -> R:
      cases (List) l:
        | empty => <base-case-expression>
        | link(first, rest) => <combine first and recursive call on rest>
      end
    end
    ```
  - Explain each part:
    - The input list `l` is of type `List<T>` (where `T` is the type of the elements inside the list).
    - The function returns a value of type `R`.
    - For the empty list, we return a base case.
    - For a non-empty list (matched by `link(first, rest)`), we combine the first element with the result of processing the rest of the list.
- **Discussion:**
  - Ask: “What are some examples of the base case for different functions?”
    - For length: base case is 0.
    - For sum: base case is 0.
    - For doubling: base case is empty.
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Have students come up with the recursive definition for a function that computes the product of a list of numbers (`my-prod`).
  - Expected code:
    ```pyret
    fun my-prod(l :: List<Number>) -> Number:
      cases (List) l:
        | empty => 1  # multiplicative identity
        | link(f, r) => f * my-prod(r)
      end
    end
    ```

### 3. Practice: Writing Recursive Functions Using the Template (20 minutes)
- **Example 1: `my-len` Revisited**
  - Review the previously “discovered” definition:
    ```pyret
    fun my-len(l :: List<Any>) -> Number:
      cases (List) l:
        | empty => 0
        | link(f, r) => 1 + my-len(r)
      end
    end
    ```
  - Ask students to trace the function on a small list (e.g., `[list: 3, 4]`).

- **Example 2: `my-sum` Revisited**
  - Revisit the recursive definition:
    ```pyret
    fun my-sum(l :: List<Number>) -> Number:
      cases (List) l:
        | empty => 0
        | link(f, r) => f + my-sum(r)
      end
    end
    ```
  - Ask: “How would you trace this on `[list: 2, 5, 7]`?”

- **Example 3: `my-str-len`**
  - Write a recursive function that, given a list of strings, returns a list of their lengths.
    ```pyret
    fun my-str-len(l :: List<String>) -> List<Number>:
      cases (List) l:
        | empty => empty
        | link(f, r) => link(string-length(f), my-str-len(r))
      end
    end
    ```
  - Ask students to test it with `[list: "cat", "elephant"]`.

- **Group Activity:**
  - In pairs, students choose one function (for example, filtering out negative numbers, i.e., `my-pos-nums`) and write its recursive definition using the template.
  - After a few minutes, invite a few pairs to share their solution. (Expected answer similar to:)
    ```pyret
    fun my-pos-nums(l :: List<Number>) -> List<Number>:
      cases (List) l:
        | empty => empty
        | link(f, r) =>
          if f > 0:
            link(f, my-pos-nums(r))
          else
            my-pos-nums(r)
          end
      end
    end
    ```

### 4. Wrap-Up and Reflection (10 minutes)
- **Recap:**
  - Summarize the general template for recursive functions over lists.
  - Emphasize that by matching on the list’s structure (empty vs. non-empty), we can systematically “peel off” one element and combine it with the recursive result.
