## [Outcomes](@/home/outcomes.md): None

### **1. Motivating Example and Overview (10 minutes)**

**Goal:** Start using images, show basic programming.

- **Scenario**: You’ve started a small *icon design studio*. Clients want custom
  icons for websites, apps, or T-shirt logos. You need a tool to produce icons
  of various shapes, sizes, and colors.

- Code that generates images -- show images, **_not_ this code**! 
```
include image

#### Sun
# Define a single orange triangle "ray":
TRI-RAY = triangle(70, "solid", "orange")

# Rotate copies of the same triangle to spread them around:
TRI-RAY-1 = TRI-RAY
TRI-RAY-2 = rotate(90, TRI-RAY-1)
TRI-RAY-3 = rotate(180, TRI-RAY-1)
TRI-RAY-4 = rotate(270, TRI-RAY-1)

# Overlay them all into one "ray shell":
ALL-RAYS = overlay(overlay(overlay(TRI-RAY-1, TRI-RAY-2), TRI-RAY-3), TRI-RAY-4)

# Place the rays behind a yellow circle to complete the icon:
overlay(circle(30, "solid", "yellow"),ALL-RAYS)


##### Badge 
# A gold circle as the badge background:
BADGE-BACK = circle(40, "solid", "gold")

# A square outline, rotated for a diamond effect:
DIAMOND = rotate(45, square(50, "outline", "black"))

# Overlay the diamond on the badge background:
overlay(DIAMOND, BADGE-BACK)

###### Speech Bubble
# A white rectangle as the main bubble
BUBBLE-RECT = rectangle(60, 40, "solid", "white")

# Outline it in black for clarity (optional):
BUBBLE-OUTLINE = overlay(
  rectangle(60, 40, "outline", "black"),
  BUBBLE-RECT
)

# A small triangle pointing downward:
POINTER = isosceles-triangle(20, 15, "solid", "white")
POINTER-OUTLINE = overlay(
  isosceles-triangle(20, 30, "outline", "black"),
  POINTER
)

# Place the pointer below the bubble rectangle:
above(POINTER-OUTLINE, BUBBLE-OUTLINE)


#### Bullseye

# Largest red circle:
CIRCLE-RED = circle(60, "solid", "red")

# White circle on top of it:
CIRCLE-WHITE = circle(40, "solid", "white")

# Smaller red circle again on top:
CIRCLE-RED-SMALL = circle(20, "solid", "red")

# Overlay them in pairs to center each circle
  overlay(
    overlay(CIRCLE-RED-SMALL, CIRCLE-WHITE),
    CIRCLE-RED
  )
```

- **Class Discussion**:
  - *Notice*: Common shapes among icons (circles, squares, symbols).
  - *Wonder*: How can we change icon size or color quickly? Can we combine shapes to form more complex images?

### **2. First Steps in Pyret / Environment Setup (15 minutes)**
**Goal:** Show how to open/run the online environment (CPO or Github Dev -- TBD).

1. **Demonstration**:
   - Open the environment, show difference between definitions & interactions.

2. **Simple Arithmetic**:
   - Type `2 + 3`, `5 * 4`, `18 / 3` in the interactions pane.
   - Show that Pyret requires spaces around operators: `2 + 3` not `2+3`.
   - Emphasize the use of parentheses -- required to disambiguate (no PEMDAS!): `(2 + 3) * 4` vs. `2 + (3 * 4)`. Note what happens if you write `2 + 3 * 4`.

3. **Interactive Exercise**:
   - *Prompt:* “Calculate the area of a rectangle with length 10 and width 3 (just do `10 * 3`) and the perimeter (`2 * (10 + 3)`).”
   - Talk through the latter, how if they used `*`, **required** parentheses.

### **3. Expressions & Combining Results (10 minutes)**
**Goal:** Introduce the idea of an *expression* as something that produces a *value*. 

1. **Definition**:
   - *Expression*: A piece of code that the language can evaluate to produce a value.
   - *Value*: A final result (e.g., a number).

2. **Examples of Expressions**:
   - `5 + 3`, `(2 + 4) * 3`, `6 * (1 + 2)`.

3. **Examples of Values**:
   - `10`, `3.5`, `-1.01`.


3. **Short Practice**:
   - *Prompt:* “Write an expression that computes `(7 - 2)` multiplied by `(3 + 1)`. Then do another that adds `6` to the result of `(3 * 2)`.”

### **4. Reflection & Wrap‐Up (5 minutes)**
- Students share any errors encountered.
- Quick look ahead: “Next time, we’ll learn how to work with text (`strings`) and images to start constructing graphic elements.”
