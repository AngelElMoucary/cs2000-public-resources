## Introduction to Tabular Data and Creating Tables

### 1. Introduction and Motivation (10 minutes)
- **Overview of Tabular Data:**  
  - Explain that many datasets—from email inboxes to inventory lists—are organized as rows and columns.
  - Discuss real-world examples:
    - *Example:* A library catalog where each book (row) has attributes like title, author, genre, and year.
    - *Interactive Question:* Ask students for more examples from their daily lives (e.g., workout logs, shopping lists).
- **Key Characteristics of Tabular Data:**  
  - Items are represented as rows.
  - Attributes (e.g., title, author) are represented as columns.
  - Each row has the same set of columns, though column values can differ in type.

### 2. Creating Tables in Pyret (15 minutes)
- **Syntax Review:**  
  - Explain the structure:  
    ```pyret
    table: col1, col2, col3
      row: value1, value2, value3
      row: value1, value2, value3
    end
    ```
- **Detailed Example: Bookstore Inventory**
  - Code Example:
    ```pyret
    bookstore = table: title, author, price
      row: "The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", 10.99
      row: "1984", "George Orwell", 8.50
      row: "To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", 7.25
    end
    ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**  
  - Have students modify the table:
    - Remove or add values.
    - Change the order of columns.
  - **Discussion:** Ask, "What errors does Pyret generate and why?"  
    - Emphasize that the number and order of items in each row must exactly match the column header list.

### 3. Extracting Rows and Cell Values (15 minutes)
- **Row Extraction:**  
  - Introduce `row-n` function. Explain zero-based indexing.
  - Code Walkthrough:
    ```pyret
    secondBook = bookstore.row-n(1)
    ```
  - **Class Discussion:** What does “row-n(1)” mean? How is it different from “row-n(0)”?
- **Extracting Cells:**  
  - Demonstrate accessing a cell value using square brackets:
    ```pyret
    secondBookPrice = secondBook["price"]
    ```
  - **Interactive Question:**  
    - What happens if the column name is given without quotation marks (e.g., `secondBook[price]`)?  
    - Discuss why quotation marks are required.
- **Small Group Activity:**  
  - Ask students to predict the output for a cell extraction, then run the code in the Pyret environment to verify.

### 4. Wrap-Up and Do Now (10 minutes)
- **Recap Key Points:**  
  - Characteristics of tabular data.
  - How to define and create a table.
  - How to extract rows and individual cell values.
- **Exit Ticket:**  
  - Ask students to list two real-life examples of tabular data and to write a small Pyret table for one of them.
- **Preview Next Lecture:**  
  - Briefly mention that the next session will explore writing functions that operate on rows and filtering/ordering tables.
