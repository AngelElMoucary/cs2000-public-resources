## Writing Examples for Table‑Producing Functions

**Topic Focus:** How to write and test functions that produce tables, including the construction of expected output tables in examples.

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Overview:**  
  - Explain that functions which transform or produce tables need clear examples for verification.
  - Emphasize that writing out expected tables might seem tedious, but using computed expressions and helper functions can simplify this.
- **Do Now:**  
  - Ask: “What kinds of everyday data could be represented as a table?”  
  - Examples: product prices, event registrations, or daily temperatures.

### 2. Example Scenario: Applying Discounts to Product Prices (20 minutes)
- **Context:**  
  - Imagine you have a table of product prices and you want to apply a discount to all products that are below a certain price.
- **Test Input Table:**  
  - Define a simple table in Pyret:
  ```pyret
  products-test =
    table: price
      row: 50
      row: 120
      row: 80
      row: 40
    end
  ```
- **Function Under Test:**  
  - Write a function `apply-discounts` that gives a 20% discount to any product priced below 100.
  ```pyret
  fun apply-discounts(t :: Table) -> Table:
    transform-column(t, "price", lam(price :: Number): 
      if price < 100 then price * 0.8 else price end
    end)
  end
  ```
  
  - Note this uses a way of defining functions as values, without names, with `lam`.  
  
- **Writing Examples:**  
  - In the examples (using a `where` block), show the expected output using computed expressions:
  ```pyret
  where:
    apply-discounts(products-test) is
    table: price
      row: 50 * 0.8      // Expected: 40
      row: 120           // No discount applied
      row: 80 * 0.8      // Expected: 64
      row: 40 * 0.8      // Expected: 32
    end
  ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**  
  - Have students modify the test table to include an edge case (e.g., a product exactly priced at 100) and write the expected output.
- **Discussion Points:**  
  - Why is it helpful to use expressions (like `50 * 0.8`) instead of manually computed numbers?
  - What constraints must the input table satisfy for `apply-discounts` to work properly?  
    (Answer: The table must include a column named `"price"` containing numbers.)

### 3. Best Practices for Table Examples (15 minutes)
- **Tips:**  
  - Simplify your test inputs: include only the columns needed.
  - Use computed expressions in expected outputs to make changes easier if your discount rate or conditions change.
  - Use helper functions when the same transformation is needed in multiple places.
- **Live Coding Session:**  
  - Instructors write additional examples (e.g., modifying the discount rate) and ask students to predict the resulting table.
- **Small Group Discussion:**  
  - Ask students to come up with another table-producing function (e.g., one that adds a tax column) and outline its examples.

### 4. Wrap-Up (5 minutes)
- **Recap:**  
  - Summarize the importance of clear, computed examples for table‑producing functions.
