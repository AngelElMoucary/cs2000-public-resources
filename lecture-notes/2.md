title: Lecture 2 - Strings & Images
---

## Outcomes: None

### **1. Quick Review (5 minutes)**
- Ask someone for an example arithmetic expression (type exactly what they say: if they don't include parentheses, _do not add them yourself_, see what error Pyret gives).
- Confirm understanding of spacing, parentheses, expression vs. value.

### **2. Introducing Strings (5 minutes)**
**Goal:** Show how text data appears in code.

1. **What Are Strings?**
   - Examples: `"Hello World"`, `"Awesome Icons"`, `"CS2000"`.
   - Emphasize the need for quotes and that strings are case‐sensitive. `"hello"` is not the same as `"Hello"`.

2. **Interactive Exercise**:
   - *Prompt:* “Type a few strings, like your name, a favorite phrase, etc., into Pyret. Leave off a quote mark on purpose and observe the error message.”

3. **Using Strings**:
   - Mention how we’ll soon use strings to name colors or track text for our icons.

### **3. Creating and Manipulating Images (25 minutes)**
**Goal:** Introduce the concept of images as another kind of data, show how to create and combine them.

1. **Basic Shapes**:
   - `circle(30, "solid", "blue")`
   - `rectangle(40, 20, "solid", "green")`
   - `triangle(50, "outline", "black")`

2. **Live Coding Demonstration**:
   - Show these shapes in the environment.
   - Change color and size.
   - Try `"outline"` vs. `"solid"` for a circle.

3. **Composition**:
   - Functions like `overlay(img1, img2)`, `beside(img1, img2)`, `above(img1, img2)`.
   - Example: creating a simple “yield sign” (a white triangle on top of a red triangle) or a “badge icon” by layering shapes.

4. **Interactive Exercise**:
   - *Prompt 1:* “Create a **blue circle** and a **yellow rectangle**, then overlay them so the circle appears on top.”
   - *Prompt 2:* “Stack a green rectangle above a purple rectangle using `above`.”

### **4. Types, Contracts & Common Errors (10 minutes)**
**Goal:** Introduce the concept of function “contracts” and why some inputs cause errors.

1. **Types**:
   - *Number*, *String*, *Image*
   - Multiplication (`*`) works with numbers, but `circle(30, "solid", "red")` is an Image.

2. **Contracts**:
   - *Example*: `* :: (Number, Number) -> Number`
   - *Example*: `circle :: (Number, String, String) -> Image`

3. **Common Errors**:
   - Wrong type: “expected Number, got Image.”
   - Wrong number of arguments: “expected 3, got 2.”

4. **Short Activity**:
   - *Prompt:* “Intentionally create an error. For example, `10 * rectangle(30, 40, "solid", "red")`. Read the error, then fix it. Notice how Pyret describes the mismatch in types.”

### **3. Documentation & Exploration (10 minutes)**
**Goal:** Encourage self‐directed learning by examining available functions in Pyret’s docs.

1. **Show Documentation**:
   - Point out the rotating/scaling/etc function list.
   - Encourage exploring new functions like `scale`, `flip-horizontal`, or `crop`.

2. **Mini‐Lab**:
   - Students choose a function they haven’t used. Try it with a shape.
   - *Prompt:* “Create a new image (like a star or triangle) and apply the new function to see what happens. Rotate it by 30°, then 60°, etc.”

3. **Optional Extension**:
   - Challenge them to re‐create a “layered target” icon with multiple circles of different colors, all centered using repeated `overlay`.



### **4. Experiment & Share (10 minutes)**
1. **Small Group Activity**:
   - Each pair tries to make a simple “icon” using at least two shapes. Could be a stylized letter, a smiley face, etc.
   - Encourage using `rotate(<degrees>, your-image)` to tilt shapes.

2. **Share**:
   - Students briefly show their icon to next group over, and the code that produced it.
