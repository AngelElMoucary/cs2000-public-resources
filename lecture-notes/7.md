Need to make some more small data sets for Mini-Project below

## Functions Over Rows and Processing Rows

### 1. Recap and Warm-Up (10 minutes)
- **Quick Recap:**  
  - Review how to create a table and extract rows/cells.
- **Warm-Up Activity:**  
  - Have students share one example they wrote from the previous class.
- **Transition:**  
  - Introduce the need to write functions that operate on rows.

### 2. Writing Functions Over Rows (20 minutes)
- **Motivation:**  
  - Explain that instead of writing repetitive code for each row, we can create functions that process a row.
- **Example: Coffee Shop Orders**
  - Introduce a new table:
    ```pyret
    orders = table: time, amount
      row: "08:00", 4.50
      row: "09:30", 3.75
      row: "10:15", 5.00
      row: "11:00", 2.95
    end
    ```
- **Function Definition:**  
  - Walk through defining a function to determine if an order is “high-value” (e.g., amount ≥ 5.0):
    ```pyret
    fun is-high-value(o :: Row) -> Boolean:
      o["amount"] >= 5.0
    where:
      is-high-value(orders.row-n(2)) is true
      is-high-value(orders.row-n(3)) is false
    end
    ```
- **Interactive Discussion:**  
  - Compare: What would be the benefit of a function that takes a row versus one that takes an index?  
  - Highlight that using the Row as an argument makes the function table‑agnostic.
- **Hands-On Exercise:**  
  - Ask students to write a similar function `is-morning` that checks if the
    time in a row (assuming a “time” column) represents a morning time (e.g.,
    before "12:00"). Discuss how to compare strings (lexicographic ordering, `<` works for strings).

### 3. Processing Rows: Filtering and Ordering (15 minutes)
- **Filtering Rows:**  
  - Introduce `filter-with`:
    ```pyret
    highOrders = filter-with(orders, is-high-value)
    ```
  - **Class Discussion:**  
    - What does `filter-with` return?  
    - Why is it more efficient than writing repetitive if-else conditions?
- **Ordering Rows:**  
  - Introduce a scenario: Find the earliest order.
  - Explain the `order-by` function:
    ```pyret
    earliestOrders = order-by(orders, "time", true)
    firstOrder = earliestOrders.row-n(0)
    ```
  - **Exercise:**  
    - Ask students to write the code to extract the order amount of the earliest order.
- **Mini-Project:**  
  - In pairs, have students choose a small dataset (TODO: PROVIDE SOME) and:
    - Write a function to filter rows based on a criterion.
    - Sort the filtered rows.
    - Extract a specific cell value from the sorted table.
  - Ask a few pairs to share their code and reasoning with the class.

### 4. Wrap-Up and Reflection (5 minutes)
- **Summarize Key Concepts:**  
  - Creating row functions.
  - Filtering and ordering rows.
- **Preview Next Lecture:**  
  - Mention that the following lecture will cover how to add and update columns using computed values.
