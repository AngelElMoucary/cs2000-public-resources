# Mutable Data Structures and the Heap

## 1. Introduction & Motivation (5 minutes)

### A. Setting the Stage
- **Context:**
  - Today we’ll explore mutable data structures—data that can change over time—and the underlying memory model that supports mutation.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Understand how both Python and Pyret represent mutable data.
  - Learn that in Pyret, mutable fields in structured data must be explicitly marked with `ref`.
  - Update our “program directory” to add a “heap”, that helps to explain aliasing and mutation.

### B. The Program Directory & Heap
- **Program Directory:**
  - Maps names to values (or, for structured data, to addresses in the heap).
- **The Heap:**
  - Structured data (like our library book) are stored in the heap—a region of memory with many slots.
  - In our model, the directory holds a name’s address (e.g., book1 → @1001), and the heap holds the actual value (e.g., @1001: LibraryBook(...)).
- **Key Contrast:**
  - In Pyret, immutable bindings are declared with `=` while mutable ones use `var` (and later updated with `:=` or, for fields, with the special `!` syntax).
  - In Python, the assignment operator `=` both declares and updates variables, and every field is mutable by default.

## 2. The Library Book Example (15 minutes)

### A. Data Design
- **Scenario:**
  - Each library book has an id, a title, and a number of available copies.
  - We want to update the available copies (e.g., when a book is borrowed).

### B. Python Version
- **Python Code using dataclasses:**
  ```python
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  @dataclass
  class LibraryBook:
      id: int
      title: str
      copies: int

  # Create a book record.
  book1 = LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)
  ```
- **Mutation in Python:**
  - To update copies, simply do:
    ```python
    book1.copies = book1.copies - 1  # e.g., borrowing a copy
    ```
  - **Discussion:**
    - Python does not require extra syntax to mark a field mutable; all fields are mutable.

### C. Pyret Version
- **Pyret Code using a datatype with mutable fields:**
  ```pyret
  # Define a LibraryBook type.
  data LibraryBook:
    library-book(id :: Number,
                 title :: String,
                 ref copies :: Number)
  end

  # Create a book record.
  book1 = library-book(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)
  ```
- Accessing mutable fields
  - To access a mutable field, you must use `!`, i.e.,:
  ```pyret
  book1!copies
  ```
  This is to highlight that the value that is returned is the _current_ value, but depending on other parts of 
  the program, it may change.

- **Mutation in Pyret:**
  - To update copies, you must use the special update syntax (the `!{...}` syntax):
    ```pyret
    book1!{copies: book1!copies - 1}
    ```
  - **Discussion:**
    - Pyret’s syntax requires mutable fields to be explicitly marked with `ref`, guarding against accidental mutation.
    - While updating one field is more verbose this way, many can be updated at once.

## 3. The Heap and Aliasing (20 minutes)

### A. Understanding the Heap
- **Program Directory Recap:**
  - In our program directory, names map to values. For structured (mutable) data, the directory maps names to addresses in the heap.
  - **Example:**
    - **Program Directory:**
      - `book1` → @1001
    - **Heap:**
      - @1001: LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)
- **Contrast in Python vs. Pyret:**
  - In both Python and Pyret, when you assign `book1 = LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)`, the program directory holds a reference (address) to the object in the heap; however, Python makes no distinction between mutable or immutable fields, since all fields are mutable!
  - In Pyret, when you print `book1`, you see an indicator (e.g., a special marker like a “caution tape”) next to mutable fields to remind you that their value can change.

### B. Aliasing
- **Definition:**
  - Aliasing occurs when two different names refer to the same object (same heap address).
- **Demonstration in Python:**
  ```python
  book1 = LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)
  book2 = book1  # aliasing: both names refer to the same object
  book1.copies = book1.copies - 1
  print(book2.copies)  # prints 4 because book2 is an alias for book1
  ```
- **Demonstration in Pyret:**
  ```pyret
  book1 = library-book(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)
  book2 = book1  # book2 now refers to the same object in the heap as book1
  book1!{copies: book1!copies - 1}
  book2!copies # Will now produce 4 since book2 is an alias to book1
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Explain that in both languages, mutation through one alias affects all aliases.
  - Note that, in Pyret, caution tape & `!` are both indicators to watch out for effects of aliasing.
  - Ask: “Why is it important to have a clear mental model (the program directory and heap) when working with mutable data?”

### C. Implications for Testing
- **Testing Mutable Data:**
  - Show that tests for functions that mutate data must consider state changes.
  - Example (briefly): If a test expects `book1.copies` to be 5 but a return or checkout operation was run, the test might fail unless state is reset.
- **Takeaway:**
  - Mutable data and aliasing introduce “state” that must be managed carefully during testing.

## 4. Equality of Data: Concepts and the Program Directory/Heap (15 minutes)

### A. Two Notions of Equality
- **Structural Equality:**
  - Two data values are structurally equal if their contents (fields) are the same.
- **Reference Equality:**
  - Two names refer to the same object (i.e., share the same address in the heap).

### B. A Library Book Record Example
- **Suppose We Have:**
  - **In both languages:**
    ```plaintext
    book1 = LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)
    book2 = LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)
    book3 = LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 3)
    book4 = book2  # Alias for book2
    ```
- **Program Directory / Heap Model:**
  - **Directory (mapping names to addresses):**
    - `book1` → @1001
    - `book2` → @1002
    - `book3` → @1003
    - `book4` → @1002
  - **Heap (values stored at addresses):**
    - @1001: LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)
    - @1002: LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 5)
    - @1003: LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 3)
- **Question:**
  - “Which books would you consider equal? How should equality behave if we update a mutable field?”

### C. Mutation and Its Effect on Equality
- **Update Scenario:**
  - Suppose we update `book2`’s copies:
    - **In Python:**
      ```python
      book2.copies = book2.copies + 2
      ```
    - **In Pyret:**
      ```pyret
      book2!{copies: book2!copies + 2}
      ```
  - **New Heap State:**
    - @1002 now holds LibraryBook(101, "The Curious Incident", 7)
  - **Observations:**
    - `book1` and `book2` now have different contents, so structurally they differ.
    - `book2` and `book4` remain aliases—both reflect the updated value.
- **Discussion:**
  - Ask: “After the update, should we consider book1 and book2 equal?”
    - Expected answer: No, because their contents now differ.
  - Ask: “What about book2 and book4?”
    - Expected answer: Yes, because they refer to the same object.


## 5. Equality Operations in Python (10 minutes)

- **Operators:**
  - `==` checks for structural equality.
  - `is` checks for reference equality.
- **Examples (using our library book records):**
  ```python
  # Before mutation:
  print(book1 == book2)  # True, since contents are identical.
  print(book2 is book4)  # True, because book2 and book4 alias the same object.

  # After updating book2:
  book2.copies = book2.copies + 2
  print(book1 == book2)  # Now False, since book1.copies is 5 and book2.copies is 7.
  print(book2 is book4)  # Remains True.
  ```
- **Interactive Exercise:**
  - Ask students to predict outputs of such comparisons before and after mutation.



## 4. Wrap-Up and Reflection (5 minutes)

### A. Recap Key Points
- **In Pyret:**
  - Mutable fields in data must be marked with `ref`, are accessed with `!` instead of `.`, and are updated using (`!{field: new_value}`).
  - The program directory maps names to addresses; the heap holds mutable structured data.
- **In Python:**
  - All fields in objects (like those created with `@dataclass`) are mutable by default.
  - The same syntax to update variables `=` also serves to update fields.
  - Python’s namespace (program directory) works similarly, but the syntax does not distinguish between declaration and mutation.
- **Aliasing:**
  - In both languages, multiple names may refer to the same mutable object, so changes via one name affect all.
