title: Lab 7 â€” Energy Grid Management

## Skills: [4](</skills/#(4)>), [5](</skills/#(5)>)

## Introduction

In this lab, you're developing the management system for a smart renewable energy grid. The system tracks solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage units, and energy consumption across multiple facilities. You have been given the following data definitions to work with:

```pyret
# DEFINITION
data EnergySource:
  | solar-panel(location :: String, capacity :: Number, efficiency :: Number, hours-sunlight :: Number)
  | wind-turbine(location :: String, capacity :: Number, wind-speed :: Number, operational :: Boolean)
  | battery-storage(location :: String, max-capacity :: Number, current-charge :: Number, charge-rate :: Number)
  | energy-consumer(location :: String, demand :: Number, priority :: String, building-type :: String)
end

# EXAMPLES
empty-grid = empty

residential-grid = [list:
  solar-panel("Roof A", 10, 85, 8),
  battery-storage("Garage", 50, 30, 5),
  energy-consumer("House 1", 15, "high", "residential")]

industrial-grid = [list:
  solar-panel("Factory Roof", 100, 90, 7),
  wind-turbine("Hill Site", 150, 25, true),
  wind-turbine("Coast Site", 200, 30, true),
  battery-storage("Main Storage", 500, 200, 25),
  battery-storage("Backup Storage", 300, 150, 15),
  energy-consumer("Factory A", 80, "critical", "industrial"),
  energy-consumer("Office Block", 25, "medium", "commercial"),
  energy-consumer("Warehouse", 40, "low", "industrial")]

campus-grid = [list:
  solar-panel("Library Roof", 50, 88, 6),
  solar-panel("Gym Roof", 30, 82, 6),
  wind-turbine("Campus Hill", 75, 20, false),
  battery-storage("Central Battery", 200, 120, 20),
  energy-consumer("Library", 35, "high", "educational"),
  energy-consumer("Dorm", 45, "high", "residential"),
  energy-consumer("Cafeteria", 20, "medium", "commercial")]
```

## Problem 1

Design a function `count-sources` that counts the total number of energy sources in the given grid.

## Problem 2

Design a function `count-operational-turbines` that counts only wind turbines that are operational.

## Problem 3

Design a function `total-solar-capacity` that calculates the total capacity of all solar panels in a grid.

## Problem 4

Design a function `repair-all-turbines` that sets all wind turbines to operational status.
