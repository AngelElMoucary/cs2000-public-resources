title: Lab 9 â€” From Pyret to Python
---

## Skills: [8](</skills/#(8)>)

The goal of this lab will be to familiarize yourself with basic Python functions.

## Problem 1

### Part A

Convert the given Pyret function into Python.

```pyret
fun book-cost(num-books :: Number, hardcover :: Boolean) -> Number:
  doc: "each paperback costs $12, while hardcover costs $25"
  if hardcover:
    num-books * 25
  else:
    num-books * 12
  end
end
```

Your code:

```python
def book_cost(num_books: int, hardcover: bool) -> float:
    """each paperback costs $12, while hardcover costs $25"""
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    pass
```

### Part B

Write `pytest` test cases for your `book_cost` function:

```python
import pytest

def test_book_cost():
    # YOUR TEST CASES HERE
    pass
```

### Part C

Write a Python function `letter_grade` that assigns letter grades based on numeric scores:

- 90-100: "A"
- 80-89: "B"
- 70-79: "C"
- 60-69: "D"
- Below 60: "F"

## Problem 2

### Part A

Design a function `c_to_f` that transforms a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, using the formula F = C * 9/5 + 32. (Hint: a list abstraction may be helpful here!)

### Part B

Design a function `long_words_upper` that, given a list of words (Strings), finds all words longer than 4 characters and convert them to uppercase. (Hint: `map` and `filter` may be helpful here!)

## Problem 3

You may **NOT** use list abstractions for the following problems.

### Part A

Write a function `sum_positives` that sums only the positive numbers in a list.

### Part B

Design a function `longest_word_info` that finds the longest string in a list and return both the string and its length.
