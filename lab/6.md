title: Lab 6 â€” Location Tags

## Skills: [4](</skills/#(4)>)

The goal of this lab will be to build many functions related to tracking tags.

## Given Data Definitions

### A PhoneId is a String

Interpretation: a unique identifier for a person's phone

Examples:

```pyret
PHONE1 = "p1"
PHONE2 = "p2"
```

Template:

```pyret
fun phone-id-temp(pi :: String) -> Any:
  ... pi ...
end
```

### A TagId is a String

Interpretation: a unique identifier for a tracking tag

Examples:

```pyret
TAG1 = "t1"
TAG2 = "t2"
TAG3 = "t3"
```

Template:

```pyret
fun tagid-temp(ti :: String) -> Any:
  ... ti ...
end
```

### An Owner is a:

```pyret
data Owner:
  | owner(phoneid :: String, tagid :: String)
end
```

Interpretation: a record of a particular phone owning a tracking tag.
There should only ever be one phone per tag, though can be many tags per phone.

Examples:

```pyret
OWNER1 = owner(PHONE1, TAG1)
OWNER2 = owner(PHONE1, TAG2)
OWNER3 = owner(PHONE2, TAG3)
```

Template:

```pyret
fun owner-temp(o :: Owner) -> Any:
  ... o.phoneid ... o.tagid ...
end
```

### A Time is a Number

Interpretation: a time represented by the number of seconds since Jan 1, 2025.

Examples:

```pyret
TIME1 = 10
TIME2 = 20
TIME3 = 30
```

Template:

```pyret
fun time-temp(t :: Number) -> Any:
  ... t ...
end
```

### An Encounter is a:

```pyret
data Posn:
  | posn(x :: Number, y :: Number)
end
data Encounter:
  | encounter(phoneid :: String, tagid :: String, time :: Number, posn :: Posn)
end
```

Interpretation: a record of a tag being seen by a given phone at a given time and location.
Note that location is represented as X,Y coordinates for simplicity.

Examples:

```pyret
ENCOUNTER1 = encounter(PHONE1, TAG1, TIME1, posn(0, 0))
ENCOUNTER2 = encounter(PHONE2, TAG1, TIME2, posn(100, 100))
ENCOUNTER3 = encounter(PHONE1, TAG2, TIME3, posn(0, 0))
```

Template:

```pyret
fun encounter-temp(e :: Encounter) -> Any:
  ... e.phoneid ... e.tagid ... e.time ... e.posn ...
end
```

## Problem 1

Design a function `tag-activity-count` that takes a TagId, a `List<Encounter>`, a start Time, and an end Time, and calculates how many times the tag has been encountered between the two times, including encounters at exactly the start and end times. Assume that the second time is greater than the first.

## Problem 2

Design a function `tag-encounter-position` that identifies all positions (0-indexed) where a specific TagId appears within a list of Encounters. If the tag id does not occur, the list may be empty.
