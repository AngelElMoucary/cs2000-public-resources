## Purpose

Introduce pair programming, start programming with Pyret

## Video Introducing Ethics



Lab starter code:

```arr

# Problem 1

# Use the circle, triangle, square, rectangle, above, and overlay/align
# functions to define a constant FACE that is an image with two eyes, a nose, and a mouth
# (and some hair if you're feeling bold). Be creative :)

# Problem 2

# Define a constant EAR and place two of them on your face,
# defining a new constant FACE-WITH-EARS. Note how in using a constant we only have to
# draw it once and get to use it twice!

# Problem 3

# The face you created probably looks a bit like emojis that you are familiar
# with. We'd like you to think more about how you chose what to make yours look
# like, and to do so, introduce a technical term:

# Representational Harm: when the identity of a person or group is
# misrepresented (e.g. perpetuating stereotypes or minimizing existence of a
# certain group).

# INTERPRETIVE QUESTION: While you may have been limited by time, imagine you
# were able to perfect your face, and the result was adopted as the main
# reaction for Apple's iMessage (in addition to ‚Äº, üëç, üëé, ‚ô•, and "haha!").
# Please explain, in 2-3 sentences, how there might be representational harms
# caused by this?
```
