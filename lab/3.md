Adapt from [https://pages.github.khoury.northeastern.edu/2500/2024F/lab/lab7.html](https://pages.github.khoury.northeastern.edu/2500/2024F/lab/lab7.html)

Very rough starting point at [https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1_Qa-ZGQF5j4LfMmv7pcSvbUt2DYQon5Y&v=dc8be4e](https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1_Qa-ZGQF5j4LfMmv7pcSvbUt2DYQon5Y&v=dc8be4e)

## Introduction
In this lab, you’ll work with a simple representation of Boston’s “Street Bump” pothole-detection data. Each pothole is modeled as a record containing its zipcode, latitude, and longitude. 

## Problem 1
For this first problem, we'd like you to define a new table `z02115` containing only rows whose `zipcode` field equals `02115`. You can find the list of Boston's potholes in the `potholes_2024.csv` file, which you should load then filter through to find potholes that are found in the zipcode `02115`. (Hint: the function `filter-with` may be helpful here!) 

## Problem 2
TODO: INTERPRETIVE QUESTION

## Problem 3
Create a new table `ordered-by-lat` that contains all the rows from your `z02115` table sorted by the "latitude" column in ascending order (so the southernmost points come first). Once you’ve built `ordered-by-lat`, define a constant `LOWEST-LAT` which extract the first row of the transformed table to identify which neighborhood has the lowest latitude. 

## Problem 4
Finally, you’ll enrich your `z02115` table by adding a new "midpt" column that captures the average of each pothole’s latitude and longitude. First, define a helper function:
```pyret
fun mid-point(row :: Row) -> Number:
    doc: "calculates the midpoint of a pothole"
    # IMPLEMENT HERE
end
```
Then, use build-column to attach "midpt" to `z02115`, producing a new table `potholes-with-midpt` where every row includes its computed midpoint.
