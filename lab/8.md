title: Lab 8 â€” Ancestor Trees
---

## Skills: [6](/skills/#(6))

The goal of this lab will be to practice on trees.

## Given Data Definition
```pyret
data AncTree:
  | noInfo
  | person(
      name :: String,
      birthyear :: Number,
      eye :: String,
      mother :: AncTree,
      father :: AncTree
    )
end
```

### Examples
```pyret
alice-tree = person("Alice", 1922, "brown", noInfo, noInfo)
bob-tree = person("Bob", 1922, "brown", noInfo, robert-tree)
charlie-tree = person("Charlie", 1945, "brown", alice-tree, bob-tree)
dave-tree = person("Dave", 1946, "green", noInfo, noInfo)
emily-tree = person("Emily", 1971, "blue", charlie-tree, dave-tree)
```

## Problem 1
Design a function `count-eye-color` that counts how many people in a tree have a given eye color.

## Problem 2
Design a function `max-generations` that finds the maximum number of generations in the tree (counting from the root person).

## Problem 3
Design a function `oldest-person` that finds the name of the oldest person in the tree (the person with the smallest birth year). If the tree is empty, raise the error "Empty tree".

## Problem 4
Design a function `names-starting-with` that returns a list of all names in the tree that start with a given letter (case-insensitive).
