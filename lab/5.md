Adapt from [https://pages.github.khoury.northeastern.edu/2500/2024F/lab/lab9.html](https://pages.github.khoury.northeastern.edu/2500/2024F/lab/lab9.html)

## Introduction
In this lab, you'll work with a dataset of ATM transactions and practice using list operations to analyze this data. Each transaction includes information such as: account ID, type of transaction (withdrawal, deposit, or transfer), transaction amount, date, location, and balance after transaction.

## Problem 1
Extract the "amount" column from the transactions table and use it to answer the following questions:

a) What is the total amount of all transactions?

b) What is the average transaction amount?

c) What is the largest transaction amount?

d) What is the smallest transaction amount?

## Problem 2
Create a function called `is-withdrawal` that takes a transaction type as input and returns true if it's a withdrawal. Then, use this function with filter to get a list of all withdrawal amounts from the transaction data and define a constant `TOTAL-WITHDRAWAL` that stores the total amount withdrawn.

## Problem 3
Extract the "location" column from the transactions table, then use the `distinct` function to find all unique ATM locations where transactions occurred.
Define a constant NUM-UNIQUE-LOCATIONS to store how many unique locations there are.

## Problem 4
Write a function `transaction-description` that takes a row from the transactions table and returns a string describing the transaction in the following format: "{account} {type} ${amount} at {location} on {date}". Then, use `map` to create a list of transaction descriptions for all transactions.
